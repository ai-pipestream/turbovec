# Changelog

All notable changes to turbovec are recorded here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The Rust crate (`turbovec` on crates.io) and the Python distribution
(`turbovec` on PyPI) version independently. Each release section below
is split by surface — a single feature can affect both, and its bullet
appears under each surface it touches.

## [Unreleased]

### turbovec-grpc — gRPC server

#### Added

- **New crate: a gRPC server for the index.** `turbovec-grpc` is a third
  workspace member alongside the Python bindings, wrapping the core crate
  behind a handle-based gRPC service so the index is reachable from any
  language with a gRPC stack, not just Python. Create or load an index, then
  add and search against a handle. `Add` is client-streaming (chunked ingest,
  no train step); `Search` is unary with an optional allowlist pushed into the
  kernel; `SearchStream` is server-streaming, one result per query as it is
  scored. Searches run under a read lock and never block one another; `add`
  and `remove` take a write lock on the single index they touch, and every
  call runs on the blocking pool. An end-to-end smoke test drives a live
  server through the full surface.

### turbovec — Rust crate

#### Added

- **`search::blocks_skipped_by_mask()` now returns `Option<u64>` (#368).**
  Counting mask-skipped blocks costs an atomic RMW per skipped block on a
  shared cache line, so it is compiled out unless the new off-by-default
  `mask-skip-counter` feature is enabled (#294). Previously the accessor
  returned a plain `0` in that case, which a telemetry consumer cannot
  distinguish from "no blocks were skipped" — two different facts sharing
  one representation. `None` now means "this build does not count".
  `BLOCKS_SKIPPED_BY_MASK` itself is no longer public for the same reason:
  reading the static directly reproduces the ambiguity the `Option` exists
  to remove. Migration: match on the `Option`; enable `mask-skip-counter`
  if you want the numbers.
- **New off-by-default cargo feature `mask-skip-counter`** — see above.
- **`turbovec::expected_codebook` and `turbovec::MIN_INPUT_NORM` are public.**
  `expected_codebook` gives callers of the raw `io::*` writers the codebook
  arrays a v6 file must embed; `MIN_INPUT_NORM` documents the norm at or
  below which a vector has no representable direction and is stored with
  scale 0 (#286).
- **v6 loads reject a file whose embedded codebook is not a valid Lloyd-Max
  codebook for its `(bit_width, dim)` (#320).** A degenerate codebook —
  collapsed or reversed centroids — previously loaded clean and silently
  mis-scored every query. New rejection class for anyone hand-writing files
  through the raw `io::*` writers.

#### Changed

- **x86 search dispatch now tests every CPU feature the kernels declare
  (#291).** The AVX2 gates additionally require FMA and the AVX-512 gates
  additionally require AVX2+FMA, matching what those kernels execute. On a
  CPU advertising AVX2 without FMA (reachable via hypervisor CPU models)
  the previous gates selected a kernel that would SIGILL on first search;
  such hosts now take the next supported path instead.
- **Masked single-query search is block-parallel (#295).** Filtered search
  previously ran serial over blocks regardless of core count. Measured at
  n=400k, d=128, 4-bit: an all-true mask went 2.04 → 0.35 ms multi-threaded
  and 2.04 → 1.11 ms single-threaded. This changes the performance profile
  of the filtered-search path specifically.
- **`IdHasher` mixes the low bits (#311).** Ids that are multiples of 2^32
  — the common `shard << 32 | seq` layout — previously collided into one
  bucket region, making add/lookup/remove quadratic. Measured over 100k
  such ids: add 1017 → 60 ms, lookup 456 → 0.2 ms, remove 448 → 0.5 ms.
  Sequential-id removes cost ~5 → ~11 ns each, the price of mixing.
- **The GIL is released at more binding sites (#288, #289, #319, #321).**
  `remove` / `swap_remove` probes, the deferred id-slot map build, and
  query validation now run detached, so they no longer stall other Python
  threads while a bulk write holds the lock.
- **AVX-512BW paired-block scoring matches NEON in two more geometries
  (#314).** With `n_byte_groups == 1` the kernel previously scored the bias
  alone, and an odd trailing group could be folded into an already-full
  flush batch, diverging from NEON's rounding. Both were unreachable with
  current legal dims.

#### Removed

- **Wheels no longer ship a `turbovec.mlx` namespace package (#305).**
  Locally-built wheels picked up stale `__pycache__` for an `mlx`
  subpackage whose sources no longer exist, so `import turbovec.mlx`
  succeeded and yielded an empty module. It now raises `ImportError`.

- **Optional fast-durability writes (#274).** `write` stays fully durable
  by default (temp file, fsync, atomic rename, and now a parent-directory
  fsync so the rename itself is on stable storage — closing a gap between
  the documented power-loss guarantee and the implementation). New
  `TurboQuantIndex::write_with_durability` / `IdMapIndex::write_with_durability`
  take an `io::Durability`: `Fast` keeps the temp-file + atomic-rename
  protocol — the destination can never hold a torn index and the previous
  file survives a process crash — but skips fsync (not power-loss-safe;
  documented). Byte-identical output either way. Measured on the 200k ×
  768 4-bit reference workload: x86 386 → 286 ms, ARM 191 → 119 ms.
- **Save-path performance (#274).** Mutations now maintain the SIMD-blocked
  cache incrementally (only touched blocks recompute), so a mutate-then-save
  no longer pays the full O(n·dim) repack: post-mutation saves dropped from
  1037 → 391 ms (x86) and 495 → 131 ms (ARM), equal to warm saves — also
  resolving the mutate-then-save item tracked in #273. On x86, path writes
  use parallel positioned writes for the codes section (small additional
  win; ARM keeps the streamed writer, where the same technique regresses).
  Temp files now carry a per-process sequence number so concurrent saves to
  one path cannot interleave.

- **File format v6 for `.tv` / `.tvim`: the file *is* the search-ready
  index — loads skip the first-search rebuild entirely (#68).** The code
  payload is now stored in the arch-neutral *sequential blocked* layout
  (32-vector blocks, one code byte per lane) instead of per-vector
  bit-plane rows, and the file embeds the Lloyd-Max codebook (~124 bytes).
  A load seeds the search caches directly: non-x86 consumes the stored
  layout as-is; x86 applies one cheap in-block nibble interleave (a
  threaded SSSE3 kernel with streaming stores and software prefetch —
  ~2 ms for a 77 MB payload vs ~400 ms for the bit-plane repack it
  replaces). Measured cold start (load → first search, 200k × dim 768,
  Apple M-series): 447 ms → 12 ms. At 2- and 4-bit the code payload is a
  permutation of the same bytes (file size unchanged apart from padding
  to whole 32-vector blocks and the ~124-byte codebook); at 3-bit the
  blocked layout stores one code per nibble, growing the code payload by
  ~33% versus the packed rows.
  - **One file.** The derived state lives inside the index — no sidecar
    files, nothing extra to ship, copy, or clean up.
  - **The format adds no platform dependence.** The stored layout and
    embedded codebook are pure functions of the index content: a v6 file
    loaded and re-saved on a different architecture is byte-identical
    (verified ARM → x86 through the SIMD interleave kernels), and readers
    use the writer's codebook instead of recomputing it — removing the
    cross-libm codebook variance from the search path. (Encoding the
    same *raw vectors* on different platforms can still differ per the
    v5 determinism scope below; v6 neither adds to nor removes that.)
  - **v5 files load unchanged.** v5 stored the same codes in a different
    layout, so the v6 loader accepts v5 and converts on load (identical
    search results); re-saving emits v6. Versions ≤ 4 remain refused with
    the rebuild hint. The writer emits v6 only.
  - **Mutations unaffected.** `add`/`swap_remove` operate on the packed
    rows, which a v6 load reconstructs lazily on first mutation; write
    serializes from the warm search cache when available (a cheap inverse
    transform) and only pays the full repack when the cache is cold.
  - `TurboQuantIndex::codes_blocked_seq` / `codebook_for_write` expose the
    v6 payload parts for embedders serializing through the raw `io::*`
    writers (whose code-payload parameter is now the blocked layout).
- **x86 insertion is 1.4-3.5x faster again** on top of the pass below
  (#273). The x86 encode path had a NEON-shaped hole in it: the
  Walsh-Hadamard butterfly ran as a radix-2 ladder (9 memory passes over
  the block at dim 1536, where the NEON path had already moved to
  radix-8), the permutation gather was scalar, the bit-packer OR-ed one
  bit at a time into a pre-zeroed row, and the reconstruction operand
  came from a hoisted table that every row streamed in full. All four
  are now closed, plus an AVX-512 butterfly and the L1-sized calibration
  transpose below. Every change is bit-identical — packed codes and
  stored scales are unmoved, enforced against the scalar reference on
  every SIMD path the host can run. Measured on x86 (Cascade Lake,
  interleaved A/B, synthetic 1536/3072-dim corpora; the official cells
  are pending a run on the GCP Sapphire Rapids instance):

  | cell | cold bulk | warm append | single add |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | d1536 2-bit ST | +72% | +2.2x | -66% |
  | d1536 2-bit MT | +53% | +45% | -66% |
  | d1536 4-bit ST | +91% | +3.2x | -74% |
  | d1536 4-bit MT | +67% | +2.6x | -74% |
  | d3072 2-bit ST | +61% | +2.8x | -64% |
  | d3072 2-bit MT | +42% | +2.6x | -64% |
  | d3072 4-bit ST | +75% | +3.5x | -73% |
  | d3072 4-bit MT | +63% | +3.4x | -71% |

  Removal is unchanged: `swap_remove` was already an O(1) swap-and-pop
  and none of this touches it.

- **Insertion and removal are substantially faster** across a ~35-commit
  optimization pass (arm d=1536 2-bit: cold bulk add ~4.7x, warm append
  ~4-6x, single add ~3x, removals ~25% faster; x86 gains larger from a
  lower base). Encode kernels are now SIMD on both aarch64 (NEON) and
  x86_64 (AVX2, runtime-detected with a scalar fallback); packed codes
  are bit-identical across the scalar, NEON, and AVX2 paths, enforced
  by cross-path identity tests.

- **File format v5 for `.tv` / `.tvim`: a deterministic block-Hadamard
  rotation, replacing the dense QR rotation (hard break).** The
  coordinate rotation that every quantized code is encoded through is now
  a globally-permuted block-Hadamard transform at k=2 rounds (ChaCha8-
  seeded ±1 sign flips → per-block normalized Walsh-Hadamard butterfly →
  a global Fisher-Yates permutation applied *before* every Hadamard,
  twice), applied in place with no matrix and no GEMM. Each round is
  permute → sign-flip → block-Hadamard; the leading permutation makes the
  transform **order-invariant**, so importance-ordered embeddings
  (matryoshka/MRL, PCA) are handled the same as any other coordinate
  ordering. The rotation is **bit-for-bit deterministic across platforms,
  CPU architectures, and thread counts** (only integer permutations and
  basic f32 add/sub/scale — no FMA, no reductions, no transcendentals;
  golden-bytes-pinned) — the property the QR rotation lacked (#206): the
  old rotation read the global rayon parallelism and used `faer`'s
  order-dependent parallel Householder reduction plus a transcendental
  sampler, so its output changed with `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` (dim ≥ 1536) and
  between libm implementations (dim ≥ 3072), and the rotate GEMM
  dispatched to a per-OS BLAS backend so the *encoded bytes* differed by
  platform. The new transform removes all three causes; recall is neutral
  versus the QR rotation (measured at dim 768/1000/1536/3072, 2/4-bit,
  including importance-ordered profiles).

  *Determinism scope:* the whole encode pipeline is bit-identical across
  thread counts on a given machine (verified). Full cross-platform byte
  identity is not yet claimed: the per-vector norm uses an FMA on aarch64,
  and the Lloyd-Max codebook is computed at runtime from `statrs` Beta
  cdf/pdf (transcendentals, the same cross-libm class as #206's finding 2)
  and is not golden-pinned. f64→f32 rounding very likely absorbs both, but
  a cross-OS byte-hash CI leg (see the recommended follow-up) is what would
  prove it.
  - **Hard break.** The rotation change rewrites every encoded byte, so
    v5 is not backward compatible. The writer emits version 5 only; the
    loader accepts version 5 only and refuses any version 1–4 index with
    a clean, actionable `InvalidData` error — *"format version N …
    incompatible with the … v5 rotation … rebuild the index"* — never a
    silent mis-decode and never a panic. There is no in-place migration;
    rebuild from the source vectors. (Format v4 — a rotation-drift
    fingerprint — was never released; it is superseded by v5. The v5
    rotation is deterministic, so no drift fingerprint is needed and the
    v4 header field is dropped.)
  - **64-bit `n_vectors`.** The count field is a u64, so indexes with
    ≥ 2³² vectors serialize exactly instead of erroring at the v3 u32
    ceiling. The in-memory top-k heap index slots widen in lockstep
    (u32 → u64) so results above slot 2³² − 1 cannot truncate. (#119)

  The ChaCha8 seed is frozen and pinned (`rand_chacha` is depended on at
  an exact version) with a golden-bytes test guarding the stream, so a
  future dependency release cannot silently change the wire format.
  Version-5 files are **not readable by earlier turbovec releases**:
  their loaders reject the version byte with a clean "unsupported format
  version" error (no silent misparse). (#206)

- **In-memory serialization: `to_bytes` / `from_bytes` on both index
  types, and generic `Read`/`Write` I/O entry points.**
  `TurboQuantIndex::to_bytes` / `IdMapIndex::to_bytes` serialize an
  index to its `.tv` / `.tvim` wire format in memory — byte-identical
  to the file `write(path)` produces — and `from_bytes` mirrors `load`
  with exactly the same validation (version handling, structural and
  value-level checks, the `.tvim` duplicate-id check), so bytes and the
  file they came from load, or fail, identically. `write_to_writer<W:
  Write>` / `load_from_reader<R: Read>` are the generic-sink forms; the
  `io` module gains the matching raw entry points `io::write_to`,
  `io::load_from`, `io::write_id_map_to` and `io::load_id_map_from`.
  `IdMapIndex` now derives `Debug`.
  This delivers the in-memory I/O half of #70 (the `from_parts` half
  landed in #204) and is the substrate for the Python stores' pickle
  support. (#148, #149, #70)

#### Changed

- **Breaking: `IdMapIndex::search_with_allowlist` returns
  `Result<(Vec<f32>, Vec<u64>), SearchError>` (#318).** It previously
  panicked on an empty allowlist and on an allowlist id missing from the
  index. Both are input conditions — allowlists are built from the
  caller's own metadata store, which drifts out of step with the index —
  so in a service they killed the worker instead of returning an empty
  page. They are now the new `SearchError::AllowlistEmpty` and
  `SearchError::UnknownId(u64)` (`#[non_exhaustive]`, like the crate's
  other error enums). The allowlist-free `IdMapIndex::search` is
  unchanged and still returns the tuple directly. Migration: add `?` or
  `.unwrap()` at `search_with_allowlist` call sites. The Python binding
  already raised `ValueError` / `KeyError` for both and is unaffected.
- **`TurboQuantIndex::dim()` / `IdMapIndex::dim()` are deprecated in favour
  of `dim_opt()` (#318).** They still return `usize`, still return the `0`
  sentinel for a lazy index, and still behave exactly as before on a
  committed index — nothing breaks. The deprecation is the signal: `0` is
  only safe for comparisons, but callers do arithmetic with a dim, so
  `buf.len() / idx.dim()` divided by zero and `vec![0.0f32; idx.dim()]`
  silently built a zero-length buffer. `dim_opt() -> Option<usize>` makes
  the uncommitted case impossible to ignore.
- **Stored per-vector scales may differ by ~1 ULP from earlier v5
  builds** for newly encoded vectors: the scale's f64 reconstruction
  inner product now accumulates through four fixed chains instead of
  one serial chain (deterministic, identical across platforms and
  thread counts; packed codes are unchanged and previously written
  files load byte-identical). Recall is unaffected.
- **Codebook boundaries are now the f32 midpoints of the f32 centroids**,
  rather than the f64 midpoints cast once to f32 — which makes the whole
  Lloyd-Max codebook reproducible across platforms, closing the second
  and last open input in the v5 determinism scope (#259 finding 2).
  The cross-OS fingerprint CI leg caught this on its first run: Linux,
  macOS and Windows each produced a *different* codebook, while
  calibration, codes and scales were byte-identical on all three. The
  f64 iteration is not bit-reproducible (`statrs`'s Beta cdf/pdf bottom
  out in `ln`/`exp`, which differ by ~1 ulp between libms, and the
  adaptive-Simpson recursion can branch differently; at 4 bits the loop
  also exhausts `max_iter` without reaching `tol`, so the f64 centroids
  settle only to ~1e-8). Casting a centroid to f32 absorbs all of that —
  measured invariant under pdf perturbations up to 1e-10 relative — but
  the *midpoint* computed in f64 sat a fraction of an f32 ulp from a
  rounding boundary and flipped under a 1e-15 perturbation at every
  (bits, dim) cell tested. Averaging the already-rounded f32 centroids
  removes the knife-edge by construction: f32 add is correctly rounded
  and `* 0.5` is exact. Boundaries move by at most 1 ULP versus earlier
  unreleased builds, so a coordinate sitting exactly on one can change
  code; both formats are unreleased, so no published index is affected.
- **The per-vector norm has one frozen reduction order on every
  architecture** — `c[j % 8] += x*x`, combined
  `((c0+c1)+(c2+c3)) + ((c4+c5)+(c6+c7))`, with separate multiply and
  add rather than an FMA. It was previously two different reductions:
  aarch64 accumulated four chains through `vfmaq_f32` (one rounding
  where the scalar path has two) while everything else summed serially,
  and those disagree in the last ulp. Since `1/||v||` rides the first
  rotation gather, that reached every encoded byte — the remaining
  cross-platform encode input the v5 determinism scope flagged
  (#259 finding 1), now closed by construction rather than by
  observation. **Newly encoded vectors can differ from earlier
  unreleased builds by ~1 ULP in the stored scale**, and at an exact
  boundary tie by one code. Measured recall is unchanged (R@1 and R@4
  identical at d1536 2/4-bit and d3072 4-bit; R@16/R@64 move by
  <3e-4, i.e. a handful of near-ties reordering). Both v5 and v6 are
  unreleased, so no published index is affected.
- `add` on a populated index no longer holds allocation-sized
  intermediates: encode appends in place and reuses a per-index scratch
  buffer, which is shrunk whenever it exceeds 4x the current batch's
  need.
- **`MAX_DIM` lowered from 65536 to 16384.** A loaded `.tv`/`.tvim`
  header declaring a huge `dim` drives allocations (codebook, blocked
  layout, per-query rotate scratch) not bounded by the file's own size,
  so the old cap — documented as the bound that "rejects the
  catastrophic cases" — still permitted a ~16 KB internally-consistent
  file to demand multi-gigabyte buffers at load or first search. 16384
  leaves >4× headroom over the largest embedding dimensions in common
  use (~4096; rare research models reach 8k–12k). The cap is enforced
  identically at construction, first add, and load — any index this
  build can create it can also load back. (#123)

#### Removed

- **The OpenBLAS / Accelerate dependency (and `faer`, `ndarray`,
  `rand_distr`).** The only use of a BLAS backend was the rotation GEMM;
  the v5 block-Hadamard rotation is applied in place with no matrix
  multiply, so the native BLAS link, the `build.rs` link-directive
  shim, and the `faer` / `ndarray` (blas feature) / `rand_distr`
  dependencies are all gone. The crate now builds with a plain `cargo
  build` and no native toolchain, which removes most of what took the
  Linux x86_64 wheel from ~1.8 MB to ~42 MB. (#206)

#### Fixed

- **The v6 codebook check no longer puts a Lloyd-Max solve on the load
  path (#357).** Validating the embedded codebook by recomputing it and
  comparing cost 25–100 ms — two orders of magnitude more than the load
  it guarded. It is replaced by the two properties that *define* the
  codebook and cost microseconds: each centroid must equal the Beta
  conditional mean of its own cell (the Lloyd-Max fixed point, evaluated
  in closed form), and each boundary must be the exact f32 midpoint of
  its neighbouring centroids. Rejection strength is unchanged or better —
  the boundary identity is now bit-exact rather than compared at 1e-4 —
  and `codebook(bit_width, dim)` is memoised process-globally, so repeat
  builds and saves of the same shape no longer re-solve either. Measured
  cold load (file → first search, 20,000 × 768 4-bit, interleaved A/B):
  66.5 → 1.00 ms at default threads, 66.6 → 0.99 ms at
  `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1`.
- **A save that committed is no longer reported as a failure (#365).**
  The rename is the commit point; a parent-directory fsync failing after
  it left the *new* file in place while `write` returned `Err`,
  contradicting the documented "the previous file at `path` is left
  untouched" guarantee and sending callers with a rollback policy down a
  destructive path (the error cleanup also silently no-opped, since the
  temp name no longer existed). Such a failure is now a durability
  shortfall, warned about on stderr, and the save reports success.

- **Add-path and loader error messages now name the condition that
  actually occurred (#329).** An id repeated inside a single
  `add_with_ids` batch reported "id N already present in index" — false
  on an empty index, and it sent callers hunting for a phantom prior
  insert; it is now the new `AddError::DuplicateIdInBatch`, "duplicate
  id N appears more than once in this batch". A zero-width batch
  (`dim == 0`, usually an embedder returning empty embeddings) was folded
  into "vector buffer length 0 not a multiple of dim 0" — mathematically
  nonsense and the wrong cause — and is now the new `AddError::ZeroDim`
  on both `TurboQuantIndex::add_2d` and `IdMapIndex::add_with_ids_2d`.
  The pre-v5 rejection hint no longer names a version number: it pointed
  at a release that does not exist and at a remedy the reader was already
  running. The `.tvim` wrong-magic error now reads "not a turbovec .tvim
  file", matching its `.tv` counterpart.
- **A zero-row `add_2d` no longer commits a lazy index's dim (#308).**
  `add_2d` set `self.dim` before delegating to `add`, whose zero-row
  no-op guard then returned — so an empty batch permanently locked the
  dim of a lazy index, changed its serialized bytes (the `dim=0` sentinel
  became the batch's dim) and survived save/load, making a later add of
  the real dimensionality fail with `DimMismatch`.
  `IdMapIndex::add_with_ids_2d` inherited it. A zero-row batch is now a
  true no-op: `dim` is still validated (a mismatch against an
  already-committed dim, or a malformed lazy first dim, reports the same
  error as before), but nothing is committed and the serialized bytes are
  byte-identical to a pristine lazy index. Realistic trigger: a lazily
  constructed framework store where `add_texts([])` or a filtered-to-empty
  batch preceded the first real batch.
- **TQ+ calibration is now a warm-up lifecycle instead of hidden
  first-add state (#107, #284, #285, #303, #317).** An index buffers its
  raw rows until it has seen 1000 vectors, then fits the calibration and
  re-encodes those rows with it, in slot order — so a first `add` of
  1–999 vectors (or a stream of 500-vector batches, the default shape of
  every framework integration) no longer locks identity calibration and
  silently forfeits the TQ+ recall gain for the index's whole life. The
  buffer is bounded by 1000 rows and mirrors `swap_remove`. Three further
  entrances to a mis-declared calibration are closed with it: the commit
  site now writes only a calibration `encode` actually fitted, so
  draining an index to empty and re-adding no longer overwrites the
  fitted calibration with identity (#284); both v6 load arms of
  `from_loaded` route through the same identity-population `from_parts`
  performs, so a v6 file with an empty TQ+ trailer plus a later `add` no
  longer produces vectors that `len` counts but search can never return
  (#303); and the new `TurboQuantIndex::calibration_state` /
  `IdMapIndex::calibration_state` accessors make the state queryable
  instead of invisible (#317). No file-format change: a stored index
  always declares exactly the calibration its codes were encoded with,
  and files written by earlier versions load unchanged.
- **Declared MSRV corrected from 1.83 to 1.89 — the crate did not build
  on the version it advertised.** The AVX-512 search kernel added in the
  v6 cycle uses `_mm512_*` intrinsics and the `avx512f`/`avx512bw`
  `target_feature` gates, all of which stabilized in Rust 1.89; on 1.83
  `cargo check -p turbovec` fails outright with `use of unstable library
  feature 'stdarch_x86_avx512'` (67 errors), so a downstream consumer
  pinned to the declared MSRV got a hard compile error rather than a
  scalar fallback. Both packages now declare `rust-version = "1.89"`,
  verified by a clean `cargo +1.89 check` of each plus the full test
  suite (19 suites) on 1.89. Found by `clippy::incompatible_msrv` while
  adding the AVX-512 butterfly, which raised the same lint against the
  pre-existing search kernel.
- **Declared MSRV corrected from 1.70 to 1.83.** The
  `rust-version = "1.70"` declared in both `Cargo.toml`s was never
  accurate: when it was introduced (2026-04-13, chosen for the crate's
  own `OnceLock` use), the dependency tree already required newer
  toolchains — `pest` 2.8.6 (transitive via
  `faer` → `npyz` → `py_literal`) requires rustc 1.83, `faer` 0.20.2
  requires 1.81, and the v4 `Cargo.lock` needs cargo ≥ 1.78 to parse.
  Both packages now declare `rust-version = "1.83"`, verified by a clean
  `cargo +1.83 check` of each. (#182)
- **Pre-AVX2 x86-64 CPUs no longer SIGILL before the scalar fallback can
  run.** The repo-level `.cargo/config.toml` set a global
  `target-cpu=x86-64-v3` (AVX2/FMA/BMI2) baseline, so every *plain* (non-
  `#[target_feature]`) function — including the runtime-dispatch prologue
  and the pre-AVX2 scalar fallback itself — was compiled with AVX/VEX
  instructions and faulted on pre-Haswell CPUs before
  `is_x86_feature_detected!` could ever select the fallback. The baseline
  is now `x86-64-v2`; the AVX2 and AVX-512 kernels stay runtime-dispatched
  and are `#[target_feature]`-gated, so they are compiled with their full
  feature sets regardless of the baseline (re-tuned by the baseline's
  tuning model). Applies only to builds made from a repo checkout — CI,
  benchmarks, and the wheel pipeline; the published crates.io `.crate`
  does not contain `.cargo/config.toml`, so `cargo add turbovec` users
  were never affected. (#137)
- **Index saves are atomic.** `io::write` / `io::write_id_map` (and
  `TurboQuantIndex::write` / `IdMapIndex::write` on top of them) now write
  to a sibling temp file, fsync, and rename over the destination, so a
  failed or interrupted save no longer destroys a previous good index at
  the same path; the TQ+ calibration-length assert also runs before any
  file is created. (#118)
- **Saving an index with ≥ 2³² vectors no longer silently wraps.**
  `write_core` previously truncated `n_vectors` with `as u32`, producing
  a corrupt file that loaded clean with `n mod 2³²` vectors. Resolved by
  the format-v4 64-bit count field (see *Added* above), which stores the
  exact count. (#119)
- **Float payloads are value-validated on load.** A `.tv` / `.tvim` with a
  non-finite or negative per-vector scale, a non-finite TQ+ shift, or a
  non-positive/non-finite TQ+ scale previously loaded clean and silently
  poisoned search results (NaN/Inf scores, vanishing or always-winning
  slots); such files are now rejected with `InvalidData`. (#122)
- **`search`/`prepare` on an empty index no longer build the dim×dim
  rotation matrix.** Searching an empty index is now O(1), which also stops
  a tiny file declaring a large `dim` with `n_vectors = 0` from driving a
  multi-gigabyte allocation on first search. (#123)
- **The published `.crate` now bundles the MIT LICENSE text.** The
  `LICENSE` file lived only at the repo root, outside the package
  directory, so cargo shipped the SPDX `license = "MIT"` metadata but not
  the notice itself (MIT requires the notice to accompany copies). A copy
  of the license is now committed inside `turbovec/`, which cargo
  auto-includes in the package. (#166)
- **Out-of-distribution vectors no longer explode their correction scale
  under frozen TQ+ calibration.** When a vector added after calibration was
  frozen reconstructed with a near-zero or negative inner product, the
  `inner.max(1e-10)` clamp turned the stored scale into up to ~1e10 (with
  a flipped sign for negative inners), letting that one vector falsely
  dominate every top-k. Reconstructions whose unit-space inner product
  falls at or below 0.1 are now treated as degenerate and store scale 0,
  so the vector scores ~0 and ranks last; any stored scale is thereby
  bounded by 10× the vector's norm. Healthy reconstructions sit well
  above the threshold (measured minima ≥ 0.56 even at 2-bit dim-8), so
  healthy vectors encode bit-identically to before on both the SIMD and
  scalar paths; the zero-vector behavior (scale 0) is unchanged. (#116)
- **`encode::encode` rejects dims that are not a multiple of 8 instead of
  writing out of bounds.** The packed layout allocates `dim / 8` bytes per
  bit-plane, so tail coordinates of a non-multiple-of-8 dim wrote past the
  end of each row — the top bit-plane panicked with an index-out-of-bounds
  and lower planes silently corrupted the next plane's bytes. The dead
  tail branch is removed and `encode` now panics up front with a clear
  message, matching the index-level validation. Unreachable through
  `TurboQuantIndex`, which already validated dim at construction. (#117)
- **A failed `add_2d` length check no longer wedges a lazy index.**
  `add_2d` committed the inferred dim before the `vectors.len() % dim`
  validation panicked, leaving the index with a locked dim and zero
  vectors — a follow-up add with a different dim saw a confusing
  `DimMismatch` instead of a fresh start. The length check now runs before
  the dim commit. (`IdMapIndex::add_with_ids_2d` already validated before
  committing and is unchanged.) (#129)
- **`IdMapIndex::search` rustdoc no longer promises a row stride of `k`.**
  The returned `(scores, ids)` are flattened with a stride of
  `effective_k = min(k, len)` — e.g. 5 vectors, 2 queries, `k = 100`
  returns 10 scores/ids per array, not 200. The doc now states the
  effective-k slicing formula and how callers recover the stride
  (`scores.len() / nq`); a regression test pins the behavior. Doc-only —
  the return shape itself is unchanged. (#120)
- Added missing rustdoc for `TurboQuantIndex` (struct summary) and for
  `SearchResults` — its `scores` / `indices` / `nq` / `k` fields
  (row-major `nq × k` layout, where `k` is the *effective* per-query
  result count) and the `scores_for_query` / `indices_for_query`
  accessors. (#162)

#### Changed

- **`TurboQuantIndex::from_parts` is now a public, validated constructor.**
  **Breaking (Rust crate).** It was `pub(crate)` and enforced its
  invariants with `assert!`; it is now `pub`, returns
  `Result<Self, FromPartsError>`, and checks every structural invariant at
  this single chokepoint — `bit_width ∈ {2,3,4}`, a committed `dim` a
  positive multiple of 8 and `≤ MAX_DIM`, `packed_codes` /`scales`/ TQ+
  array lengths (with the implied packed size computed via checked
  arithmetic, so huge `n_vectors` yields a named error rather than an
  overflow), the lazy-state constraints, and the same value-level checks
  as the file loader (finite non-negative per-vector scales, finite TQ+
  shifts, finite positive TQ+ scales — so an accepted index always
  survives its own `write` → `load` round-trip) — returning a named
  `FromPartsError` instead of panicking. This is the supported low-level
  construction path for embedders that hold an index payload in memory
  (e.g. a database page) and want to skip the `.tv`/`.tvim` file
  round-trip. The paired accessors `packed_codes()`, `scales()`,
  `tqplus_shift()` and `tqplus_scale()` are likewise promoted from
  `pub(crate)` to `pub` so an index round-trips through external storage.
  New public error type `FromPartsError`; `TurboQuantIndex` now derives
  `Debug`. (#141, #142; delivers the low-level API requested in #70)

#### Removed

- **The unchecked low-level kernels are no longer public.**
  **Breaking (Rust crate).** `codebook::codebook`, `encode::encode`,
  `pack::repack` and `search::search` are now `pub(crate)`. They trust
  their caller's invariants with no validation, so on the public surface
  they were a soundness and DoS hazard: `search::search` performed
  out-of-bounds reads / SIGBUS from inconsistent caller lengths — undefined
  behaviour reachable from safe code (#141); `encode`/`repack` panicked
  opaquely on malformed lengths or `bits == 0`, and `codebook` hung on an
  unbounded `2^bits` allocation for `bits` in ~32..63 and produced
  silently-wrong output for `bits ≥ 64` / degenerate `dim` (#142).
  *Migration:* construct through the validated `TurboQuantIndex::from_parts`
  or the high-level `TurboQuantIndex` / `IdMapIndex` types, which establish
  these invariants for you. The `dump_state` dev example, which existed
  only to dump the now-internal `codebook`, was removed with it. (#141, #142)
- Dead `avx2_block_epilogue` in `search.rs` (x86-only, ~190 lines, no
  callers). The live AVX2 epilogue helpers are `avx2_batch_flush_to_fa`
  and `avx2_post_flush_heap_update`; the dead copy's logic had drifted
  from them, so keeping it invited confusion in future kernel edits. No
  behavior change. (#134)
### turbovec — Python package

#### Added

- **Interruptible long search/add (#216).** A large batch `search` / `add`
  / `add_with_ids` is now processed one row-slice at a time (default
  `turbovec.BATCH_CHUNK_SIZE = 1000`, overridable per call with
  `chunk_size=`), so control returns to Python between slices and a queued
  Ctrl-C is serviced there instead of at the end of the call. The GIL was
  already released (#186), but Python delivers signals on the main thread —
  the one parked inside the Rust kernel — so a Ctrl-C used to be queued
  until the whole call returned. Measured on a ~7.2 s batch search: the
  Ctrl-C delay dropped from ~5.4 s (queued to the end) to ~10 ms (within
  one slice). Pure-Python wrappers over the native kernels — no core
  change. Chunked results are identical to a single call (each `search`
  slice reads one coherent snapshot of the query array, preserving the
  mid-search-mutation guarantee; each `add` slice is committed atomically).
  Throughput cost is asymmetric: `search` is unaffected (~0 %), but a
  chunked `add` / `add_with_ids` pays a snapshot, per-slice validation and
  dispatch, and (`add_with_ids`) an O(n) pre-existing-id check — measured
  at roughly 2–7× the unchunked wall time at the default `chunk_size=1000`
  (the base add is fast, so fixed per-slice overhead dominates the ratio;
  it varies with dim/batch/machine). The absolute overhead is small, on the
  order of ~1–10 µs/vector. For a throughput-critical one-shot bulk load,
  pass `chunk_size=0` to run the add whole at full speed. A cancelled `add` commits the completed slices and raises — the
  index stays consistent and queryable at that count. Two calls stay
  indivisible and deaf to Ctrl-C by design: a single huge query
  (`nq == 1`) and the *first* add into an empty index (it fits and locks
  the TQ+ calibration from its batch, so slicing it would change the whole
  index's quantization). Making those interruptible needs a core
  cancellation poll (`PyErr::CheckSignals` in the hot loops) — the deferred
  follow-up.
- `write(path, durable=False)` on `TurboQuantIndex` and `IdMapIndex`:
  keeps atomic-replace semantics but skips fsync (not power-loss-safe) —
  see the Rust-surface entry for details and measurements (#274).

- **Per-store similarity modes for all four integration stores**
  (LangChain, Haystack, LlamaIndex, Agno), fixed at construction and
  recorded in the persisted side-car. Two modes:
  - **`cosine` (the default).** Document vectors are L2-normalized
    before they reach the quantized index and query vectors before
    search, so raw scores are true cosine similarity in `[-1, 1]` for
    embeddings of any magnitude, and ranking matches each framework's
    in-tree reference store (`InMemoryVectorStore`,
    `InMemoryDocumentStore`'s cosine branch, `SimpleVectorStore`).
    Zero vectors cannot be normalized and are kept as-is — they score
    `0` against everything, matching the references.
  - **`dot_product` (explicit opt-in).** Raw vectors, raw
    inner-product scores, magnitude-aware ranking — exactly the
    previous behavior. Absolute score thresholds are dataset-relative
    in this mode and need calibrating per embedder.

  Parameter surface per store: Haystack's existing native
  `embedding_similarity_function` ("cosine"/"dot_product") now selects
  the mode (and, as before, the `scale_score` formula); Agno's existing
  `distance` parameter accepts `Distance.cosine` (default) and now also
  `Distance.max_inner_product` (`Distance.l2` still raises); LangChain
  and LlamaIndex gain a `similarity: str = "cosine"` keyword (a
  documented turbovec extension — their references compute cosine
  unconditionally). Unknown mode values raise `ValueError`. (#114)

- **`turbovec.__version__`.** The package now exposes the standard
  version attribute (resolved lazily via PEP 562 from the installed
  dist metadata, so `import turbovec` stays sub-millisecond —
  importing `importlib.metadata` eagerly would multiply the import
  time by ~25x). Falls back to `"0.0.0.dev0"` when no dist metadata
  is installed. (#153)
- **`to_bytes()` / `from_bytes(data)` on `TurboQuantIndex` and
  `IdMapIndex`.** Serialize an index to `bytes` in its `.tv` / `.tvim`
  wire format — byte-identical to the file `write(path)` produces —
  and reconstruct it from those bytes with exactly the same validation
  as `load` (corrupt or drifted payloads raise `ValueError`). Both run
  with the GIL released; `from_bytes` accepts `bytes` or `bytearray`.
  This is the in-memory persistence path (caches, databases, pickling)
  that previously required a filesystem round-trip. (#148, #70)
- **All four integration stores are picklable and copyable.** The
  LangChain, Haystack, LlamaIndex, and Agno stores implement
  `__getstate__` / `__setstate__` (the Rust index rides along as its
  `.tvim` bytes; the per-store lock — and Haystack's async executor —
  are excluded and recreated on restore), `__deepcopy__`, and
  `__copy__`. The state is snapshotted under the store's writer lock,
  so a pickle overlapping a write captures a consistent index/side-car
  pair (per-doc payload dicts are copied deeply enough that an
  in-place metadata update landing mid-pickle cannot tear the
  snapshot). `pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(store))` round-trips
  documents, metadata, search results, the similarity mode, and the
  handle counter, including into `multiprocessing` spawn workers. `copy.copy` deliberately equals
  `copy.deepcopy`: there is no meaningful shallow copy of a store —
  sharing the mutable Rust index means mutations bleed between the
  copies (see *Fixed*). (#148, #149)

#### Changed

- **Index file format break (v5): saved indexes from older versions no
  longer load.** The Python package inherits the Rust crate's format v5
  rotation break (see the Rust section): any `.tv` / `.tvim` file, pickle,
  or `to_bytes` payload written by an earlier turbovec — including the
  framework stores' on-disk state — is refused on load with an actionable
  "rebuild the index" error rather than silently mis-decoding. Rebuild
  affected indexes from the source vectors. In exchange, encoded output is
  now deterministic across platforms and thread counts, and the wheel no
  longer bundles OpenBLAS. (#206)

- **LangChain: non-`str` ids are now rejected with `TypeError` at the
  add boundary** (`add_texts` / `aadd_texts` / `add_documents` /
  `from_texts` and async variants), naming the offending id, its type,
  and its position, before any embedding-store mutation. Previously an
  off-contract id (the declared type is `list[str]`) was accepted
  in-memory and then corrupted by JSON persistence: an `int` id `2`
  round-tripped as the string `"2"`, and an int id coexisting with its
  equal-looking str id (`2` + `"2"`) produced a duplicate JSON key on
  `dump` that `load` collapsed — one document silently destroyed and
  the side-car left unloadably out of sync with the index. This is a
  deliberate safer-than-reference deviation: `InMemoryVectorStore`
  accepts non-str ids and exhibits the same dump/load corruption.
  `None` entries in an explicit ids list are still replaced with
  generated UUIDs; `bool` (a subclass of `int`) is rejected like any
  other non-str type. (#124)
- **Default scoring of the four integration stores changes for
  non-unit-normalized embeddings.** Under the new `cosine` default the
  stores normalize documents at add time and queries at search time, so
  scores and ranking are cosine — previously they were raw inner
  products (magnitude-aware). For unit-normalized embedders (OpenAI,
  Cohere, sentence-transformers with `normalize_embeddings=True`) the
  scores are identical up to quantization noise and nothing changes.
  For non-unit embedders, freshly built stores now rank by angle
  rather than by `‖v‖·‖q‖·cosθ`, and score magnitudes move from
  unbounded to `[-1, 1]` — this is the fix for #114; opt into
  `dot_product` mode to keep the old ranking. **Persisted stores are
  unaffected:** a side-car written before the mode field existed holds
  raw vectors and loads in `dot_product` mode, keeping scoring
  byte-identical with zero migration (see the schema notes below).
  (#114)
- **Integration side-car schemas record the similarity mode** (each
  bumped per its own versioning convention; every loader still accepts
  all older versions):
  - LangChain `docstore.json` v1 → v2 (`similarity` field; v1 loads as
    `dot_product`).
  - LlamaIndex `nodes.json` v2 → v3 (`similarity` field; v1/v2 load as
    `dot_product`).
  - Agno `docstore.json` v1 → v2 (`distance` field; v1 loads as
    `max_inner_product`, updating `self.distance` to match; a v2 file
    whose recorded mode conflicts with the constructor's `distance`
    raises `ValueError` at `create()` because Agno's
    construct-then-load shape means both sides hold a mode).
  - Haystack `docstore.json` v2 → v3 (`vectors_normalized` field;
    v1/v2 vectors were always written raw whatever their recorded
    `embedding_similarity_function`, so they load with normalization
    off and keep the recorded function for the `scale_score` formula —
    byte-identical behavior, including the saturating cosine-branch
    `scale_score` those stores had). New writes into a legacy-loaded
    store stay raw (mixing normalized and raw rows would corrupt
    ranking). (#114)
- **All four integration stores are now safe for concurrent
  multi-threaded use; writes serialize on a per-store lock.** The
  LangChain, Haystack, LlamaIndex, and Agno stores adopt a layered
  design measured in the #161 research: every mutating method
  (add/write/insert, delete, upsert, update, clear/drop — sync and
  async) and every save path (`dump` / `save_to_disk` / `persist` /
  `save`) serializes on a per-store `threading.RLock`; reads take no
  lock, so concurrent searches keep overlapping and scaling across
  threads (#186). Adds now populate the side-car maps *before* the
  index insert (with a failure-unwind preserving the #89
  "a failed add never destroys existing data" guarantee) and deletes
  remove from the index *first*, so a search can never surface a
  handle that doesn't resolve; result translation skips handles whose
  entries a concurrent delete removed mid-search, and filtered
  searches retry a stale allowlist and fall back to a non-raising
  post-filtered search under sustained churn. The resulting contract:
  a read overlapping a write sees pre- or post-write state, and under
  heavy concurrent churn a search may transiently return fewer than
  `k` results. There is still no cross-call atomicity, and
  multi-process access remains unsupported. (#161)
- **Haystack `write_documents` under `FAIL`/`NONE` now partial-writes like
  the reference instead of being atomic.** Previously the whole batch was
  validated up front and a `DuplicateDocumentError` left the store
  untouched. `InMemoryDocumentStore` instead commits each document as it
  iterates and raises on the *first* duplicate, persisting every
  preceding non-duplicate document. Per the maintainer ruling on #167,
  the store now matches that post-exception state exactly: documents are
  validated and committed one at a time in batch order, so after the
  raise everything before the first colliding id is persisted (an
  in-batch repeat keeps its already-committed first instance). Each
  individual document commit remains all-or-nothing, so a document
  failing turbovec's own embedding validation mid-batch persists the
  documents before it and leaves the index and id maps consistent.
  `OVERWRITE`/`SKIP` semantics and all success-path return counts are
  unchanged. (#167)

#### Fixed

- **agno: a half-present save loaded silently empty and was then
  overwritten (#328).** `create()` caught the `FileNotFoundError` that
  `_load_from` raises for a folder holding only one of
  `index.tvim` / `docstore.json` and built a fresh empty index instead,
  so the next `save()` overwrote the surviving file and the data was
  gone. Only a folder with *neither* artifact is treated as a fresh
  path now; a partial store propagates the "missing one of ..." error.
  The other three stores load through explicit classmethods that already
  propagate, and are unchanged.

- **`write()` errors now name the file and use `FileNotFoundError`
  (#329).** `TurboQuantIndex.write` / `IdMapIndex.write` raised a bare
  `OSError: No such file or directory (os error 2)` identifying no path,
  so a batch job writing several paths could not tell which failed and
  `except FileNotFoundError:` around a write never matched. Both now go
  through the same path-appending helper `load` uses. Duplicate-id and
  zero-width-batch messages from the add path are corrected with the
  Rust-side change above, and a persisted-store corruption message no
  longer leads with the internal "handle" vocabulary.
- **A zero-row `add` / `add_with_ids` no longer commits a lazy index's
  dim (#308).** `TurboQuantIndex(bit_width=4)` followed by
  `idx.add(np.zeros((0, 768), np.float32))` left `idx.dim == 768`, so the
  next real batch of a different dimensionality raised
  `ValueError: dim mismatch`, and the wedged dim survived
  `write` / `load` and `to_bytes` / `from_bytes`. An empty batch is now
  the documented no-op: `idx.dim` stays `None` and `to_bytes()` is
  byte-identical to a pristine lazy index.
- **Framework integrations: four parallel implementations of the same
  semantics, brought back into line (#321, #302, #322, #301).** The
  langchain / llama_index / haystack / agno stores each re-implement the
  same store contract, so a fix landed on one has repeatedly been missed
  on its siblings. This round closes four such gaps:
  - **agno: a failed `insert` could destroy a pre-existing document.**
    The other three stores capture the previous state before the
    maps-first write and restore it when the index add raises; agno's
    unwind popped the handle unconditionally, so when a corrupt
    `next_u64` watermark reissued a live handle the unwind deleted the
    *victim's* payload and unlinked the *new* document's id and name.
    agno now captures and restores like its siblings, restoring the
    "a failed add never destroys existing data" guarantee.
  - **Persisted-store validation now checks the handle watermark.**
    `check_persisted_handles` verified duplicate handles, count parity
    and index membership, but never that `next_u64` sits at or above the
    largest handle in use — so a stale, hand-edited or partially-written
    side-car loaded cleanly and then failed every subsequent write with
    a leaked internal handle id. All four stores inherit the check.
  - **llama_index: `delete(None)` wiped every parentless node.** Nodes
    with no SOURCE relationship stored `ref_doc_id = None`, so
    `delete(node.ref_doc_id)` on a parentless node deleted all of them.
    A parentless node is now filed under the literal `"None"`, matching
    `SimpleVectorStore`: `delete(None)` is a no-op, `delete("None")`
    targets them.
  - **llama_index metadata filters: two divergences from
    `SimpleVectorStore`.** `TEXT_MATCH` is case-**insensitive** again
    (the reference lowercases both sides), and a **missing** metadata key
    now fails `NE`/`NIN` as it already failed every other operator — the
    reference returns `False` for all operators once the value is absent.
    The previous behaviour was justified against
    `vector_stores.utils.build_metadata_filter_fn`, which does not exist
    in the supported llama-index-core range; `simple.py` holds the only
    in-tree evaluator and is now the reference of record.
  - **langchain: `dot_product` mode no longer fakes a `[0, 1]`
    relevance.** The relevance mapping clamped, so every raw inner
    product `>= 1.0` became exactly `1.0` — a `similarity_score_threshold`
    retriever admitted unrelated documents, and the clamp also suppressed
    the out-of-range warning `VectorStore` emits. In `dot_product` mode
    the mapping is now unclamped and selecting a relevance fn emits a
    `UserWarning`; cosine (the default) is unchanged and still clamped.
  - **Reference-parity API gaps.** langchain gains
    `similarity_search_with_score_by_vector` (and its `a`-prefixed
    variant) — the only non-deprecated public method the
    `InMemoryVectorStore` reference exposes and we lacked, so user code
    got `AttributeError` rather than `NotImplementedError`. haystack's
    `embedding_retrieval` now performs the reference's up-front
    `ValueError("query_embedding should be a non-empty list of floats.")`
    instead of returning `[]` on an empty store or reporting a dim
    mismatch. `top_k=-1` still raises here where the reference returns
    `n - 1` documents: a negative count is a caller bug, not a request.
- **TQ+ calibration warm-up (#107, #284, #285, #303, #317).** See the
  Rust-crate entry for the lifecycle change. On the Python side: both
  index types gain a read-only `calibration_state` property
  (`"warming_up"` / `"fitted"` / `"identity"`); saving an index that is
  still warming up emits a one-shot `RuntimeWarning`, because a file
  carries no warm-up buffer and the reloaded copy is committed to
  identity calibration for good; and the interruptibility wrapper no
  longer chunks an add into a warming-up index, since the calibrating
  add must see its whole batch to stay bit-identical to an unchunked
  one (it already made the same exception for the first add).
- **Fork safety: turbovec no longer deadlocks in a `fork()`ed child.**
  rayon's thread pool does not survive `fork()` — its worker threads live
  only in the parent, so the first parallel op a forked child ran (a batch
  search, or any `add`) injected work into a worker-less registry and hung
  forever. This wedged the default configurations of `multiprocessing`
  (fork start method — the Linux default through 3.13), gunicorn
  `--preload`, Celery prefork, and PyTorch `DataLoader(num_workers>0)`;
  single-query searches "worked" only by accident (a length-1 parallel
  iterator folds inline and never enters the pool), so smoke tests passed
  while the first batch or write silently wedged. The extension now routes
  every rayon-using kernel through a process-local pool: a forked child
  detects the fork (via `os.register_at_fork`, with a `pthread_atfork`
  backstop) and transparently rebuilds the pool on its first call, so its
  parallel ops run on live workers. Inherited-index searches return
  identical results in parent and child; the single-query hot path is
  unchanged (within measurement noise). Remaining unsafe cases (documented,
  no library fix): forking *while another thread is mid-`add`/`search`*
  (POSIX async-signal-safety limit) and co-loaded OpenMP/MKL, which stays
  independently fork-unsafe. (#147)
- **LlamaIndex: dotted namespaces no longer silently collide in a shared
  `persist_dir`.** The persistence stem handling used `with_suffix`,
  which re-split the stem at its last dot, so namespaces `v1.2` and
  `v1.3` both persisted to `v1.tvim` / `v1.nodes.json` — the second
  persist silently overwrote the first (data loss), and
  `from_persist_dir(namespace="v1.2")` returned the other namespace's
  data. Extensions are now appended to the full namespace-derived stem
  (`v1.2__vector_store.tvim` / `v1.2__vector_store.nodes.json`), so
  dotted namespaces coexist. Non-dotted namespaces keep byte-identical
  file paths — no migration. A store persisted by an earlier release
  under a dotted namespace still loads: when the correct filename is
  absent but the old mangled one exists, `from_persist_path` falls back
  to it (safe — the mangling meant at most one store could survive per
  mangled prefix), and the next `persist` writes the correct names.
  `_validate_namespace` additionally rejects `:` (a Windows
  drive-relative name like `C:foo` escapes `persist_dir` with no
  separator), extending the #152/#197 guard. (#200)
- **Threshold and relevance-score paths are no longer broken for
  non-unit-normalized embeddings** (the three wave-8 findings on #114
  — all symptoms of the mappings assuming cosine input while the
  engine returned raw inner products; fixed by the `cosine` default
  above, which makes the existing `(sim + 1) / 2` mappings correct):
  - **LangChain:** `as_retriever(search_type="similarity_score_threshold")`
    returned `[]` for any threshold when all raw inner products fell
    below `-1` (every relevance clamped to `0.0`), and distinct
    high-scoring documents all clamped to relevance `1.0`
    (indistinguishable — no threshold could separate them). Relevance
    scores are now distinct, ordered, and threshold-usable.
  - **Agno:** `similarity_threshold` was effectively inert — small
    thresholds discarded everything on all-negative raw scores and
    large thresholds admitted everything on large-positive ones. It now
    behaves as a true `[0, 1]` relevance cutoff under the default mode.
  - **Haystack:** `embedding_retrieval(..., scale_score=True)` on the
    default cosine function collapsed distinct scores to `1.0`,
    violating the "same ranking, mapped into [0, 1]" contract; scaled
    scores are now distinct and order-preserving. (#114)
- **Declared MSRV corrected from 1.70 to 1.83.** Building the PyPI
  package from source (sdist, or a platform with no prebuilt wheel) now
  correctly requires rustc 1.83 — the toolchain the dependency tree has
  in fact required all along; the 1.70 declared in
  `turbovec-python/Cargo.toml` was never sufficient. Prebuilt-wheel
  users are unaffected. (#182)
- **Pickling a LlamaIndex store no longer silently returns an EMPTY
  store (total data loss).** `pickle.dumps` / `pickle.loads` of a
  populated LlamaIndex `TurboQuantVectorStore` *appeared* to succeed
  but dropped the Rust index on the floor: it lives in a pydantic
  `PrivateAttr`, and the inherited `BaseComponent.__getstate__`
  removes any private attribute that fails `pickle.dumps` with only a
  log warning — so the store deserialized valid-looking and every
  query returned `[]`. This hit exactly the scenarios users pickle
  for (caching, `multiprocessing`, Ray, Celery): ship a populated
  store, workers silently search an empty one. The store now pickles
  faithfully via the new `to_bytes` / `from_bytes` core API; the
  LangChain, Haystack, and Agno stores — which previously raised
  `TypeError: cannot pickle 'builtins.IdMapIndex' object` — now
  round-trip too. (#148)
- **`copy.copy` of a store no longer aliases the Rust index, and
  `copy.deepcopy` works.** A shallow copy of any of the four stores
  shared the underlying mutable `IdMapIndex` and side-car maps, so
  mutating the copy silently mutated the original (and vice versa) —
  and `copy.deepcopy`, the only safe alternative, raised `TypeError`
  because deepcopy rides the pickle path. Both now return a fully
  independent store (`__copy__` is deliberately identical to
  `__deepcopy__`; a shared-index "shallow" copy is precisely the bug).
  (#149)
- **LlamaIndex `add()` no longer loses data under concurrent calls.**
  `_next_u64 += 1` on a pydantic `PrivateAttr` is not atomic under
  the GIL, so two concurrent `add()` calls could issue the same
  handle — the second batch was rejected with an opaque
  `ValueError: id already present` and its documents silently never
  stored (measured: 0.78% of adds under 2-thread ingest). Handle
  issuance now happens under the store's writer lock. (#161)
- **Concurrent search / retrieval no longer raises transient
  `KeyError` / `RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during
  iteration` while another thread writes.** This closes the measured
  crash classes in all four stores, including Agno's
  delete-vs-delete cleanup-scan crash and the misleading
  `KeyError: allowlist contains id(s) not present in index` from a
  delete racing a filtered search. Load-time validation is
  unchanged: a corrupt persisted store still fails loudly at load.
  (#161)
- **The x86_64 Linux and Windows wheels run on pre-AVX2 CPUs.** The
  wheels are built inside the repo checkout, so they inherited the repo
  `.cargo/config.toml`'s global `target-cpu=x86-64-v3` baseline: every
  plain (non-`#[target_feature]`) function — including the runtime
  dispatch and the scalar fallback itself — contained AVX/VEX
  instructions, and importing-and-searching on a pre-Haswell x86-64 CPU
  faulted (SIGILL) before the fallback could be selected. The wheels now
  build at the `x86-64-v2` baseline; AVX2/AVX-512 hardware still gets the
  `#[target_feature]`-gated SIMD kernels via runtime dispatch, compiled
  with their full feature sets regardless of the baseline (re-tuned by
  the baseline's tuning model). (#137)
- **Agno's `TurboQuantVectorDb` accepts `bit_width=3`.** The constructor
  guard rejected 3 even though the core `IdMapIndex` — and the langchain,
  haystack, and llama_index stores built on it — fully support it; the
  guard now accepts `{2, 3, 4}` and still raises `ValueError` for
  anything else. The integration docs and docstrings that described the
  contract as `{2, 4}` now state `{2, 3, 4}`, matching the core. (#138)
- **LlamaIndex `TurboQuantVectorStore.from_persist_dir(namespace=...)`
  rejects path-traversal namespaces.** `namespace` is composed into the
  side-car filename (`{persist_dir}/{namespace}__vector_store.json`), so a
  value containing a path separator or `..` (or an empty/`.` namespace)
  escaped `persist_dir` and read an arbitrary sibling/parent file. Such a
  namespace now raises `ValueError` naming the offending value, rather than
  silently loading a different store than the caller named. Any other
  namespace (alphanumerics, dash, underscore) is accepted verbatim. This
  deliberately diverges from `SimpleVectorStore`, which does not sanitize
  its namespace, in the safer direction. (#152)
- **Optional-dependency floors now match what the integrations actually
  need.** Three of the four extras declared minimums whose APIs the
  integration code relies on did not exist yet, so `pip install
  turbovec[haystack]`/`[agno]` could resolve to versions that crash on
  import or construction. Empirically verified floors (lowest version
  where the full per-integration test file passes):

  | extra | old floor | new floor |
  |---|---|---|
  | `langchain` | `langchain-core>=0.3` | unchanged (verified honest) |
  | `llama-index` | `llama-index-core>=0.11` | unchanged (see next bullet) |
  | `haystack` | `haystack-ai>=2.0` | `haystack-ai>=2.23.0` |
  | `agno` | `agno>=2.0` | `agno>=2.5.4` |

  haystack-ai below 2.1.0 was unimportable next to our integration, below
  2.16.0 lacked `ByteStream.to_dict`/`from_dict` (blob persistence), and
  below 2.23.0 could not serialize a pipeline containing the store;
  agno below 2.5.4 rejects the `similarity_threshold` kwarg the store
  passes to `VectorDb.__init__` (and below 2.2.0 all of the
  `id`/`name`/`description` kwargs too), so every construction failed.
  (#160)
- **LlamaIndex `ALL`/`ANY` metadata filters no longer crash on
  llama-index-core 0.11.x–0.12.5.** The operator dispatch referenced
  `FilterOperator.TEXT_MATCH_INSENSITIVE` (added in llama-index-core
  0.12.6) unconditionally before the `ALL`/`ANY` branches, so on older
  releases those queries — and the `FilterCondition.NOT` dispatch —
  died with `AttributeError`. The newer enum members are now resolved
  with `getattr` sentinels, keeping the honest `>=0.11` floor while
  still supporting `TEXT_MATCH_INSENSITIVE`/`NOT` where the installed
  version provides them. (#160)
- **Loading a missing index file raises `FileNotFoundError`.**
  `TurboQuantIndex.load` / `IdMapIndex.load` previously raised a bare
  `OSError` for a nonexistent path, so `except FileNotFoundError:`
  never matched — and the LlamaIndex `from_persist_path` was the one
  integration load that surfaced it (the other three open their JSON
  side-car with Python's `open()` first). The binding now maps
  `io::ErrorKind::NotFound` to `FileNotFoundError` and appends the
  offending path to every load error message; an existing-but-corrupt
  file still raises the plain `OSError` family. (#156)
- **An over-large `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` no longer makes the first
  `add`/`search` die with an uncatchable `PanicException`.** A value
  above the OS thread limit (`ulimit -u`) made rayon's lazy global
  thread-pool construction fail (EAGAIN) and panic. The module now
  builds the pool at import time when the variable is set, clamping
  the request to 4x the available parallelism with a `RuntimeWarning`
  naming the variable and the cap. When the variable is unset (or `0`,
  rayon's "auto"), nothing changes — rayon's lazy auto-sized pool is
  preserved exactly, and values at or under the cap keep producing
  byte-identical results. Note: an explicitly-set value above the cap
  that previously happened to work unclamped (e.g. `2000` under a
  permissive OS thread limit) is now clamped too and emits the warning;
  search/save results are byte-identical either way, only the thread
  count changes. (#158)
- **The bindings release the GIL around compute-bound core calls.**
  `TurboQuantIndex` / `IdMapIndex` `search`, `add` / `add_with_ids`,
  `prepare`, `write`, and `load` previously held the GIL for their full
  duration, stalling every other Python thread and serializing
  concurrent searches that the core index explicitly supports. The
  concurrency contract per index object is: reads (`search`, `prepare`,
  `write`, `contains`, `len`) may run in parallel with each other; a
  write (`add`, `add_with_ids`, `remove`, `swap_remove`) blocks until it
  has the index to itself and then succeeds — the same
  serialize-then-succeed outcome writes always had, now enforced by an
  internal reader-writer lock instead of the GIL. Inputs borrowed from
  numpy arrays (queries, vectors, ids, masks, allowlists) are
  snapshotted into owned buffers before the GIL is released, so a
  Python thread mutating an input array mid-call cannot corrupt or
  perturb the running operation. Long calls still cannot be interrupted
  with Ctrl-C mid-operation (signal polling is a separate concern).
  (#121)
- Added the `Operating System :: Microsoft :: Windows` classifier to the
  PyPI metadata — Windows x64 wheels have shipped since 0.4.3 but the OS
  classifiers listed only Linux and macOS. (#143)
- **LangChain: a `None` entry in an explicit `ids` list is replaced with a
  generated UUID** at add time (matching the reference
  `InMemoryVectorStore`), instead of being stored as `None` and silently
  rewritten to the string `"null"` by a `dump`/`load` round-trip. (#124)
- **LangChain: `add_texts` always returns a fresh `list[str]`** — passing
  `ids` as a tuple previously returned the tuple unchanged. (#126)
- **LangChain: a non-dict metadata entry (e.g. `None`) is rejected with a
  `TypeError` naming the bad entry, before any state is touched.**
  Previously the crash was an opaque `'NoneType' object is not iterable`
  raised *after* the vectors had been added to the index, leaving the
  docstore and index desynced in memory — and a subsequent `dump()`
  persisted the corruption. (#139)
- **LangChain: generator / one-shot-iterable inputs are materialized once
  at each entry point** (`add_texts` / `aadd_texts` `metadatas` and `ids`,
  `add_documents` / `aadd_documents`, `from_texts` / `afrom_texts`), and
  `from_texts` tests emptiness via `len()` so a numpy array of texts works.
  Previously such inputs were iterated more than once — drained on the
  first pass — producing misleading length-mismatch / `len()` /
  ambiguous-truth-value errors. `delete` / `adelete` get the same
  treatment: a multi-element numpy array of ids previously crashed on the
  `if not ids:` emptiness test. (#157)


- **LlamaIndex: `NE` / `NIN` metadata filters now match nodes missing the
  filtered key**, mirroring llama-index-core's `build_metadata_filter_fn`.
  Previously such nodes were silently dropped from filtered `query`,
  `get_nodes`, and `delete_nodes` results. (#132)
- **LlamaIndex: `get_nodes(node_ids=...)` returns nodes in requested-id
  order** (previously storage/insertion order), consistent with the
  LangChain integration's `get_by_ids`. The filters-only path keeps
  storage order. (#150)
- **LlamaIndex: `add()` accepts generators and other one-shot iterables.**
  The input was iterated twice, so a generator drained on the first pass
  and crashed with a misleading "expected 2D embedding batch, got 1D";
  it is now materialized once up front, as `async_add` already did.
  (#157, LlamaIndex case)
- **Haystack: `embedding_retrieval(filters={})` no longer raises
  `FilterError`.** An empty filter dict is now treated as "no filter",
  matching the reference `InMemoryDocumentStore` and the store's own
  `filter_documents`. (#131)
- **Haystack: `write_documents` no longer crashes on a `Document` whose
  `meta` is `None`** (off-contract, but `Document(..., meta=None)` keeps
  the `None` as-is); it is coerced to `{}`. (#139)
- **agno: `insert()` / `upsert()` accept numpy-array embeddings** instead
  of raising numpy's truth-value-ambiguous `ValueError`, matching
  LanceDb's tolerance. (#135)
- **agno: a `None`-valued metadata filter no longer matches documents
  missing the key.** `search(filters={"k": None})` returned — and
  `delete_by_metadata({"k": None})` deleted — the entire collection;
  both now require the key to be present and equal, matching LanceDb. (#144)
- **agno: concurrent `async_upsert` calls of the same `content_hash` no
  longer retain stale generations.** The previous generation's handles
  were captured before the awaited embed, so sibling tasks never removed
  each other's rows; `async_upsert` now awaits only the embedding and
  delegates to the sync `upsert` (last-writer-wins, same as sync). (#146)
- **agno: `drop()` on a store with a persistence `path` deletes the
  on-disk artifacts** (`index.tvim` / `docstore.json`), so a later
  `create()` starts empty instead of resurrecting the dropped data.
  Also, `delete_by_content_id(None)` / `update_metadata(None, ...)` are
  now no-ops instead of matching every document stored without a
  `content_id`. (#169)
- **agno: `search()` / `async_search()` deduplicate duplicate-content
  results.** `LanceDb.search` — the drop-in reference — unconditionally
  collapses the final result list by `md5(doc.content)`, keeping the
  first occurrence; turbovec returned every duplicate, handing callers
  (e.g. retrieved-chunks-to-LLM pipelines) duplicated context and a
  different result count. Per the maintainer ruling on the issue, dedup
  now runs as the final search step, after filtering and rerank —
  LanceDb's exact ordering — and, like LanceDb, without over-fetching,
  so a search returns fewer than `limit` documents when duplicate-content
  hits exist. Duplicate-content rows are still stored and individually
  deletable; only search results collapse. (#136)
- **Wrong dtype/ndim array arguments raise a clear `TypeError`** that names
  the argument and states expected vs got (e.g. "vectors must be a 2-D
  float32 array, got 2-D float64") instead of pyo3's opaque "'ndarray'
  object cannot be cast as 'ndarray'". Applies to `vectors`, `queries`,
  `ids`, `mask`, and `allowlist`; wrong dtypes are still rejected, never
  silently converted. (#127)
- **Negative and out-of-`uint64`-range integer arguments follow per-method
  semantics** instead of raising a bare, context-free `OverflowError`:
  `swap_remove` raises the `IndexError` its docstring documents, membership
  checks (`in` / `contains` / `remove`) return `False` for ids that can
  never be present, and `k` / `dim` / `bit_width` raise a `ValueError`
  naming the argument. (#128)
- **Integration load paths now validate the side-car's internal key-sets,
  not just the handle ↔ index bijection.** A desynced side-car (partial
  copy, stale backup, hand edit) previously loaded clean and failed later —
  an opaque `KeyError` mid-query, or silently missing results. All four
  integrations now raise a clean `ValueError` at load instead:
  - **agno**: `_load_from` skipped the index/side-car consistency check the
    other integrations run; a desynced `docstore.json` loaded clean and
    orphaned vectors were silently dropped from search results. It now
    calls the shared handle check. (#115)
  - **LangChain**: `load()` didn't require `docs` and `str_to_u64` to hold
    the same document ids; a `docs` entry missing for a mapped id raised
    `KeyError` inside `similarity_search`. (#125)
  - **LlamaIndex**: `from_persist_path` didn't require `nodes` and
    `node_id_to_u64` to hold the same node ids (nor the id map to be 1:1);
    a missing `nodes` entry raised `KeyError` inside `query()`. (#133)
  - **Haystack**: `load_from_disk` accepted a side-car with duplicate
    document ids, which collapsed the rebuilt id map and left a shadow
    document that was searchable but unreachable by id.
- **Integration saves no longer destroy a previously-good store on
  failure.** All four framework integrations (LangChain `dump`, LlamaIndex
  `persist`, Haystack `save_to_disk`, agno `save`) wrote the index and then
  truncate-and-wrote the JSON side-car in place, so a save that failed
  mid-serialization — e.g. a document whose metadata holds a `set` or
  ndarray — left the destination with a new index and a truncated side-car,
  unloadable and unrecoverable. Saves now serialize the side-car fully in
  memory first (bad metadata raises before any file is touched) and write
  both files via fsynced sibling temp files moved into place with
  `os.replace`, removing the temp files on failure. (#159)

### Benchmarks

- **Official persistence cells, x86 insert re-measure, and ARM
  re-baseline (#279, #280).** The published ARM benchmark environment
  moved from an Apple M3 Max laptop to a **GCP c4a-standard-8 (Google
  Axion, 8 vCPU)** instance — release build, idle box — and every ARM
  cell (search, insert, remove, persist) was re-measured there. The x86
  cells stay on the same GCP c3-standard-8 (Sapphire Rapids) box; the
  x86 insert and persist cells were re-measured on a clean release build
  at the PR base commit (fresh `target/` + `maturin develop --release`,
  provenance verified after an earlier run reused a pre-#277 build). The
  fresh clean-build run agreed with the committed x86 insert numbers
  within measurement noise across all 8 cells, so the committed bytes
  were retained: #277's encode speedup was measured on Cascade Lake and
  does not move Sapphire-Rapids bulk insert. (The agreement is what the
  ST≈MT single-add invariant confirms — single `add()` is serial, so a
  cell's ST and MT single-add timings must match, and across the grid
  they do.) All 16 `speed_persist_*` cells
  (arm + x86, both threadings) are now recorded in `benchmarks/results/`
  and `create_diagrams.py` renders matching
  `docs/{arm,x86}_persist_{st,mt}.svg` save/load figures (save-warm and
  load→first-search as precision-matched TurboQuant-vs-FAISS pairs; the
  mutate→save→load→search round-trip, which FAISS has no measured
  equivalent for, shown TurboQuant-only). README search prose (ARM now
  16–24%) and the ARM figure labels were updated to the new environment.
- **Persistence benchmarks join the suite** (#275): `speed_persist_*`
  for every (dim, bit width, arch, threading) cell, covering write in
  both states (warm blocked cache vs invalidated by a mutation — ~5x
  apart, so a single "save time" would hide the interesting half),
  `load` and `load → first search` separately (the gap v6 removed),
  and `mutate → save → load → first search` as one checkpoint/resume
  pipeline, each against FAISS `write_index` / `read_index`. Page-cache
  state is warm and stated; the fsync + atomic rename turbovec does and
  FAISS does not is called out in the scripts as a deliberate
  durability difference rather than a gap to close.
- **`examples/insert_bench`**: a Rust harness reproducing the suite's
  four mutation metrics on deterministic synthetic vectors, so an
  optimization hypothesis can be measured in seconds without the OpenAI
  corpus or FAISS. Official numbers still come from
  `benchmarks/suite/`.
- Insertion and removal speed benchmarks join the suite. (#65) For every
  published search-speed cell (d=1536/3072 × 2-bit/4-bit × ARM/x86 ×
  ST/MT), `benchmarks/suite/` gains `speed_insert_*` — bulk `add()` into
  an empty index (rotation/codebook init + TQ+ calibration fit included),
  a warm append with calibration frozen (the steady-state encode path),
  single-vector `add()` latency, and a FAISS `IndexPQFastScan` bulk-add
  baseline — and `speed_remove_*` — `IdMapIndex.remove(id)` per-op
  latency and throughput against a raw `TurboQuantIndex.swap_remove`
  baseline, isolating the id-map layer's bookkeeping. Fresh index per
  timed run (add is cumulative, remove shrinks the index), fixed seeds,
  median of 5, results in `benchmarks/results/` like the rest of the
  suite. ARM (Apple M3 Max) and x86 (Intel Sapphire Rapids, c3-standard-8)
  results are both recorded. `create_diagrams.py` gains matching figures
  (insertion throughput ST/MT, removal latency) for both architectures.
- `benchmarks/download_data.py` downloads to a `.tmp` sibling and renames
  into place on success, so an interrupted download no longer leaves a
  partial file at the final path that the existence guard then treats as
  complete. (#140)
- **Misbehaving embedders now raise errors that name the embedder as the
  cause.** (#154) Three error-quality gaps — no data corruption or desync
  in any of them, just opaque errors:
  - LangChain `add_texts` / `aadd_texts` validate that the embedder
    returned one vector per text. A short batch previously surfaced as
    `expected N ids, got M` from the index (or an `IndexError` when the
    batch contained duplicate ids); it now raises
    `embedder returned X vectors for Y texts`. The query path likewise
    rejects `embed_query` returning `None` or a non-1D result with an
    error naming the embedder instead of an opaque PyO3 boundary `TypeError`.
  - Agno `insert` / `async_insert` no longer crash with
    `TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()` when a batch
    embedder returns `None` instead of the embeddings list — the
    documents are treated as un-embedded and the existing
    `failed to embed N document(s)` error is raised.
  - LangChain, Haystack, and LlamaIndex stores reject batches of empty
    (dim-0) embeddings — shape `(N, 0)` passed the 2D-batch guard and
    died in the index kernel with `vector buffer length 0 not a multiple
    of dim 0`; they now raise an error pointing at the embedder / embed
    model. (Agno already caught this mode via its missing-embedding
    check.)

### CI

- **MSRV leg**: reads `rust-version` out of both manifests, checks they
  agree, and builds with exactly that toolchain. The declared MSRV has
  been wrong twice (1.70 → 1.83 → 1.89) and both times it took a human
  to notice; now it cannot drift from reality silently.
- **SIMD coverage gate, wired into the Rust legs.**
  `TURBOVEC_REQUIRE_SIMD=avx2,avx512f` makes the kernel identity tests
  *fail* when a listed feature is missing rather than silently skipping
  the paths gated on it — without it a runner lacking a feature
  exercises nothing and still reports green, so the absence of coverage
  is invisible. CI sets `avx2`, which every GitHub-hosted x86 runner
  has. AVX-512 is deliberately not required there (hosted runners do not
  guarantee it), so those kernels remain single-machine-verified until a
  designated runner or an Intel SDE leg covers them.
- **Cross-OS encode fingerprint leg** (#259). `examples/encode_hash`
  encodes a fixed LCG fixture across six (dim, bit width) cells and
  prints a hash per pipeline stage — codebook, calibration, codes,
  scales, whole file. Each OS in the matrix runs it; a `needs:` job
  fails unless all three agree. Hashing per stage means a divergence
  names the stage that drifted — which it did on the very first run:
  the codebook differed on all three OSes while calibration, codes and
  scales matched, localizing the cause to the boundary midpoints (fixed
  above) rather than to "the encode". Boundaries and centroids are
  hashed as separate columns for exactly that reason.

### Docs

- README gains an "Insertion & Removal Speed" section after Search Speed:
  ARM insertion-throughput (ST/MT) and removal-latency figures generated
  from the new `speed_insert_*` / `speed_remove_*` results, with the
  measurement setup stated and results linked. x86 figures follow once
  the x86 cells are run. (#65)
- Agno integration: the "Basic usage" example called
  `Knowledge.load_text(...)`, which no longer exists in current agno
  (2.7.x) and raised `AttributeError` on copy-paste. The example now uses
  `knowledge.add_content(text_content=...)`. (#164)
- `docs/api.md`: two points where the Rust API doesn't mirror the Python
  examples are now called out — a lazy index's first add on the Rust API
  must use `add_2d` / `add_with_ids_2d` (the flat forms require an
  already-committed dim and panic otherwise); and the allowlist result
  width is `min(k, unique ids in allowlist)` — the allowlist is
  deduplicated, so repeated ids don't widen the result. (#168)
- The `[Unreleased]` compare link pointed at the stale `v0.8.1` tag,
  folding the entire 0.9.0 release into "Unreleased"; it now compares
  against `v0.9.0`. (#143)

## turbovec 0.8.0 (Python package) + turbovec 0.9.0 (Rust crate) — 2026-06-10

Security-audit release. Two adversarial audit passes over the core crate,
the Python binding, and the framework integrations, hardening the
untrusted-file load path and the Python API surface and fixing several
data-integrity bugs in the integration wrappers. Resolves #104, #105, and
#106. No on-disk format change (still `.tv` / `.tvim` v3).

A few fixes change observable behavior — see **Changed** under each surface.
They turn previously-undefined or silently-wrong situations into clean,
typed errors, so the bump is minor rather than patch.

### turbovec — Rust crate (current: 0.8.1 → next: 0.9.0)

#### Fixed

- **Untrusted index files are validated before allocation on load.** A
  crafted `.tv` / `.tvim` could previously trigger an integer-overflow in
  the packed-size computation, drive a multi-gigabyte allocation from a
  tiny file, divide-by-zero in the repack step, or load a structurally
  invalid index that returned silently-wrong scores (a `bit_width` of 5–8
  passed the old length check). The loader now range-checks `bit_width` and
  `dim`, computes every size with checked arithmetic, and reads each payload
  through a length-capped reader. (#105)
- **x86 scalar fallback returned wrong results.** On pre-AVX2 x86 (or VMs
  without AVX2), `score_query_into_heap` read the perm0-interleaved code
  layout as if sequential, producing an incorrect top-k. It now
  de-interleaves correctly; verified end-to-end against the SIMD kernels on
  AVX-512 hardware. (#106)

#### Changed

- **`AddError` and `ConstructError` are now `#[non_exhaustive]`.** Downstream
  `match` on these enums must carry a wildcard arm; in exchange, future error
  variants are no longer breaking changes. (The new `DimTooLarge` variant is
  why this release is the moment to make the switch.)
- **`dim` is capped at `MAX_DIM` (65536)** at construction, first add, and
  load. `search` lazily builds a `dim`×`dim` rotation matrix whose size is
  not bounded by any file, so an unbounded `dim` was a load-time
  resource-exhaustion vector. Larger dims now return a typed error.
- **A zero-`dim` lazy add is rejected** with `AddError` instead of panicking
  with a divide-by-zero and wedging the index.

#### Removed

- Dead, untested `pack::repack_3bit` (no callers; 3-bit goes through
  `repack`).

#### Other

- The crate now fails to compile on non-64-bit targets (a `compile_error!`
  gated on `target_pointer_width`). The size/offset arithmetic in
  `encode`/`pack`/`search` assumes 64-bit `usize`; refusing to build on
  32-bit/wasm avoids shipping a silently-unsafe (potential out-of-bounds)
  build there.

### turbovec — Python package (current: 0.7.1 → next: 0.8.0)

#### Fixed

- **`search()` no longer panics on NaN / Inf / oversized query
  coordinates.** These previously raised an uncatchable `PanicException`
  (a `BaseException`); they now raise `ValueError`, matching `add`. (#105)
- **Loading a malformed `.tv` / `.tvim` raises a clean error** instead of
  panicking or driving a huge allocation (the Rust load-path hardening
  above, surfaced through the binding).
- **agno: duplicate derived `doc_id` no longer orphans vectors.** Two
  documents that derive the same id (a repeated `doc.id`, or identical
  content) are both kept and both deletable, matching agno's reference
  store (LanceDb appends). Previously the earlier vector was counted and
  searchable but unreachable by id, and leaked on every upsert. (#104)
- **agno: `delete_by_name` / `delete_by_content_id` / `delete_by_metadata`
  no longer over-delete.** When distinct documents collided on a
  content-derived `doc_id`, deleting by one attribute also deleted the
  id-twin; deletion now targets only the documents matching the predicate.
- **LangChain / Haystack / LlamaIndex: a persisted JSON side-car that is out
  of sync with its `.tvim` index now raises a `ValueError` at load** instead
  of an opaque `KeyError` deep inside a later query.
- **Internal binding result-shape errors map to `RuntimeError`** rather than
  an uncatchable panic.

#### Changed

- `search()` and the index constructors now raise `ValueError` for
  non-finite query values and for `dim` outside the supported range, where
  some of these inputs previously panicked or were silently accepted.

### Docs

- Corrected stale benchmark figures in the README (recall deltas, ARM/x86
  speed ranges) to match the current `benchmarks/results/`; several had
  drifted from before the TQ+ calibration step landed.

## turbovec 0.7.1 (Python package) + turbovec 0.8.1 (Rust crate) — 2026-06-09

Bug-fix release. Two data-safety fixes in the Python integration wrappers'
add/upsert paths, plus a source-build fix for the Python extension on macOS.
The Rust crate is functionally unchanged — only non-behavioral cleanups —
but is re-released to keep crates.io in sync with the source tree. No
on-disk format change (still `.tv` / `.tvim` v3).

### turbovec — Rust crate (current: 0.8.0 → next: 0.8.1)

#### Changed

- Internal cleanup only, **no behavior change** — the published crate
  behaves identically to 0.8.0. Cleared three build warnings (two unused
  bindings in the NEON scoring kernels; the scalar `score_query_into_heap`
  fallback is now `cfg`-gated out of `aarch64` builds, where the NEON
  kernel is always used and it was dead code) and corrected stale SIMD
  module/kernel doc comments.

### turbovec — Python package (current: 0.7.0 → next: 0.7.1)

#### Fixed

- **Intra-batch duplicate ids no longer orphan vectors** in the LangChain
  and Haystack integrations. A repeated id within a single `add_texts` /
  `add_documents` / `write_documents` call previously added one vector per
  row while the id→handle map kept only the last, leaving the earlier
  vectors live in search but mapped to the wrong document and unreachable
  for delete. Both now resolve duplicates the way their reference stores
  do — LangChain (`InMemoryVectorStore`) keeps the last occurrence;
  Haystack (`InMemoryDocumentStore`) applies the `DuplicatePolicy` against
  the batch-so-far. Fixes #90.
- **Upsert no longer destroys existing data when the new batch fails
  validation**, across all four integrations (LangChain, LlamaIndex,
  Haystack, Agno). The old vectors for matching ids were deleted *before*
  the incoming batch was validated/encoded, so a dimension change or a
  non-finite embedding left the store with the originals already gone. The
  delete is now deferred until after the add succeeds (Agno captures the
  previous generation's handles and removes them after `insert`). Fixes
  #89.
- **Plain `cargo build` of the extension now links on macOS.** Building
  `turbovec-python` from source failed with "symbol(s) not found for
  architecture arm64" because nothing emitted the Python extension-module
  linker args (maturin injects them; a bare `cargo build` did not). Added a
  `build.rs` calling `pyo3_build_config::add_extension_module_link_args()`.
  Prebuilt wheels were unaffected. Fixes #92.

## turbovec 0.7.0 (Python package) + turbovec 0.8.0 (Rust crate) — 2026-05-30

Audit-driven correctness pass on every layer (Rust core, Python bindings,
four integration wrappers). Headline: 14 active bugs found and fixed,
hundreds of regression tests added, doc drift cleaned up across the
public API. No on-disk format change (still `.tv` / `.tvim` v3).

### turbovec — Rust crate (current: 0.7.0 → next: 0.8.0)

#### Added

- **`AddError::InvalidInputValue { vector_index, coord_index, value }`** —
  new error variant returned by `TurboQuantIndex::add_2d` and
  `IdMapIndex::add_with_ids_2d` when an input coordinate is non-finite
  (NaN, +Inf, -Inf) or has magnitude `>= 1e16`. Without this validation
  the encode pipeline silently corrupted the index: NaN/Inf propagated
  through `simd_norm` and poisoned `vec_scales[slot] = NaN`, making the
  slot exist in `len()` but unreachable through `search`; huge magnitudes
  overflowed the f32 norm to `+Inf`, making the slot win every query.
- **Scalar fallback in the x86_64 search dispatch.** Previously, `search`
  on an x86_64 CPU without AVX-512 BW or AVX2 silently returned empty
  top-k results for every query (the SIMD `unsafe { if/else if }` block
  had no `else`). Rare in practice on modern hardware but the failure
  mode was the worst kind.

#### Changed

- **Breaking**: `AddError` no longer derives `Eq` (the new
  `InvalidInputValue` variant carries an `f32`, which isn't `Eq` because
  `NaN != NaN`). `PartialEq` is still derived. Downstream code that
  pattern-matches `AddError` exhaustively will need to add the new
  variant.
- `TurboQuantIndex::add` / `add_2d` / `search` / `search_with_mask` now
  reject non-finite / huge-magnitude inputs at entry. `add` and `search`
  panic with a clear message (matching their existing precondition-
  panic style); `add_2d` and `add_with_ids_2d` return
  `Err(InvalidInputValue)` for callers handling untrusted input.
- `TurboQuantIndex::from_parts` asserts structural invariants
  (packed_codes / scales / TQ+ length relationships) at entry, catching
  any future caller that bypasses the read-layer validation.
- Rustdoc on `add`, `add_2d`, `search`, `search_with_mask`, and
  `IdMapIndex::add_with_ids` now documents every panic condition
  introduced by the input validation.

#### Fixed

- **`IdMapIndex::add_with_ids_2d` partial-mutation on inner failure.**
  ID tables (`id_to_slot` / `slot_to_id`) were mutated before delegating
  to the inner `add_2d`. If the inner call returned `Err` (e.g.
  `DimMismatch` on a committed-dim index), the ID tables retained `n`
  ghost entries pointing at slots that didn't exist in the inner index —
  corrupting later `search_with_allowlist` / `remove`. Fixed by capturing
  `base_slot` before, running inner add first, mutating ID tables only
  on success.
- **v2-loaded index + `add` silently mis-encoded new vectors.** Loading a
  pre-TQ+ (v2) file left `tqplus_shift` empty; the next `add` saw
  `existing = None`, fit fresh calibration, encoded the new batch with
  that calibration — but then silently dropped the fitted shift/scale
  because the `n_vectors != 0` else branch only extended `packed_codes`
  / `scales`. The new vectors then got searched against identity
  calibration, producing silently wrong scores. Fixed by populating
  explicit identity TQ+ in `from_parts` when loading a v2-shaped state.
- **Empty first add froze identity calibration forever.** `add(&[])`
  hit the `n < TQPLUS_MIN_SAMPLES` branch in `encode`, returned
  identity, and the `n_vectors == 0` branch wrote it to
  `self.tqplus_shift`. Every subsequent add — even a million-vector
  batch with rich distribution — then saw `existing = Some(identity)`
  and silently skipped fresh fitting. Fixed by short-circuiting `add`
  to a true no-op when `n == 0`.

### turbovec — Python package (current: 0.6.0 → next: 0.7.0)

#### Changed

- **Breaking** (typed-exception hygiene): `TurboQuantIndex.add` /
  `search` and `IdMapIndex.add_with_ids` / `search` now raise
  `ValueError` for non-finite or huge-magnitude coordinates, non-
  contiguous numpy arrays, and wrong-dim queries. Previously these
  surfaced as Rust panics → `PanicException` in Python.
- **Breaking**: `TurboQuantIndex.swap_remove` now raises `IndexError`
  for out-of-range indices (was a Rust panic).
- `IdMapIndex.search` and `TurboQuantIndex.search` now return consistent
  shapes for empty queries — `(0, min(k, n_vectors, n_allowed))` on
  both. Previously `IdMapIndex` returned `(0, k)` (raw `k`), diverging
  from `TurboQuantIndex`'s `(0, min(k, n))`. For `IdMapIndex`, the
  `effective_k` computation also now dedups the allowlist for the
  `nq == 0` path, matching the kernel's mask-based dedup for `nq > 0`.

#### Fixed

- **`turbovec.langchain.TurboQuantVectorStore`**: `similarity_search`,
  `similarity_search_with_score`, and `similarity_search_by_vector` now
  populate `Document.id` on returned hits (was silently `None`). The
  `Document` passed to user-supplied filter callables also carries
  `.id` so predicates can filter on it. Fixes #81.
- **`turbovec.haystack.TurboQuantDocumentStore`**: `Document.blob` and
  `Document.sparse_embedding` now survive write → retrieval round-trip
  (were silently dropped). Docstore schema bumps `v1 → v2` with
  backward-compat load. Filter shape validation tightened to match
  `InMemoryDocumentStore` (bare `{"field": "x"}` shapes are rejected).
  Docstring scoped back from "matches the public surface of
  `InMemoryDocumentStore`" since `bm25_retrieval` is not implemented.
- **`turbovec.llama_index.TurboQuantVectorStore`**: full `BaseNode`
  fidelity through `query` / `get_nodes` / persist+load. PREVIOUS /
  NEXT / PARENT / CHILD relationships, `excluded_embed_metadata_keys` /
  `excluded_llm_metadata_keys`, template fields (`text_template`,
  `metadata_template`, `metadata_separator`), `start_char_idx` /
  `end_char_idx`, and `mimetype` were silently dropped — now preserved
  via `node_to_metadata_dict` / `metadata_dict_to_node`. Nodes schema
  bumps `v1 → v2` with backward-compat load. Plus:
  - `FilterCondition.NOT` now supported (was `NotImplementedError`).
  - `FilterOperator.TEXT_MATCH` is now case-sensitive (matches the
    reference; previously silently lowercased both sides).
  - `FilterOperator.TEXT_MATCH_INSENSITIVE`, `ALL`, `ANY` added.
  - `query.mode != VectorStoreQueryMode.DEFAULT` raises
    `NotImplementedError` instead of silently behaving as DEFAULT.
  - `add()` rejects intra-batch duplicate `node_id`s with a clear
    `ValueError` (previously, the index ended up with both vectors but
    only the last node_id mapped back to one, orphaning the first handle
    and silently returning the second node's payload attached to the
    first node's vector).
- **`turbovec.agno.TurboQuantVectorDb`**: `embedder` is now threaded
  through returned `Document` objects so `doc.embed()` / `doc.async_embed()`
  work on retrieved hits (previously raised "No embedder provided").
  Empty query strings short-circuit to `[]` (matching LanceDb).

## turbovec 0.6.0 (Python package) + turbovec 0.7.0 (Rust crate) — 2026-05-27

### turbovec — Rust crate (current: 0.6.0 → next: 0.7.0)

#### Added

- **TQ+ per-coordinate calibration.** Before the data-oblivious rotation,
  every coordinate is shifted by its empirical 5th percentile and scaled
  so that the 5–95% range maps to `[0, 1]`. The shift/scale pair is
  fit incrementally from the cold-path `add` data, so the index stays
  online — no separate train pass, no rebuilds as the corpus grows.
  At search time, the same affine is applied to the query before the
  rotation. Recall@1 lifts across published cells:
  - GloVe-200 4-bit:   0.8440 → 0.8498 (+0.6pp)
  - OpenAI-1536 2-bit: 0.876  → 0.891  (+1.5pp)
  - OpenAI-1536 4-bit: 0.966  → 0.974  (+0.8pp)
  - OpenAI-3072 2-bit: 0.911  → 0.929  (+1.8pp)
  - OpenAI-3072 4-bit: 0.971  → 0.974  (+0.3pp)

  No public API change — TQ+ is always-on. The cost is one extra pass
  per `add` batch to update the running quantile estimates, paid once
  on the cold path; search latency is essentially unchanged.

- **Cross-arch top-K parity.** The AVX2 and AVX-512 BW kernels now
  produce byte-identical top-K result sets to the NEON kernel for any
  deterministic input. Per-vector f32 scores still differ by ~1e-5
  relative across arches (different SIMD reduction orders), but those
  rank swaps are confined to within-tie vectors and never change set
  membership. Verified via the new `examples/kernel_xtest.rs` smoke
  test (sha256 of sorted-per-query top-K indices matches across all
  three SIMD paths).

#### Changed

- **On-disk format version bumped to 3** for both `.tv` and `.tvim`.
  v3 appends a TQ+ trailer (per-coord shift + scale arrays) after the
  existing scales section. The v3 reader is **backward-compatible**:
  v2 files load with empty TQ+ vectors (identity calibration). Files
  written by 0.7.x cannot be loaded by 0.6.x or older; there's no
  forward-compat shim. Reindexing from source vectors picks up the
  TQ+ recall lift; loading an old v2 file gives you the pre-TQ+
  numbers.

- **x86 LUT-build is no longer data-dependent.** The AVX2 and AVX-512
  BW kernels previously capped `max_lut` at `min(127, 65535 / n_byte_groups)`
  to keep their no-flush u8→i16 accumulators in range — which at
  d=1536/4-bit clamped to 42, and at d=3072/4-bit to 21, opening a
  visible recall gap vs ARM (−1.6pp and −5.5pp respectively). Both
  kernels now batch the inner loop by `FLUSH_EVERY=256` byte-groups
  and run a mini-epilogue (SUB-trick + i16→f32 + fmadd into per-query
  f32 accumulators) at the end of each batch — the same structure
  NEON has used since 0.5.x. `max_lut` is now unconditionally 127 on
  every arch. x86 speed is essentially flat vs the previous release
  (the per-batch flush eliminates the same work from the single final
  epilogue).

### turbovec — Python package (current: 0.5.3 → next: 0.6.0)

#### Added

- **TQ+ per-coordinate calibration.** Same kernel-level change as the
  Rust crate; Python users see no API change. `TurboQuantIndex.add()`
  carries a small extra pass per batch to update the running quantile
  estimates (one-shot cold-path cost; search latency unchanged), and
  `.search()` returns higher recall on the cells listed above. The
  README's "How it works" section documents the calibration step.

#### Changed

- **On-disk format version bumped to 3** for both `.tv` and `.tvim`.
  Same forward-compat policy as the Rust crate: old v2 files load
  fine into 0.6.0+ (with identity calibration), but indexes written
  by 0.6.0+ cannot be loaded by ≤ 0.5.3. Reindex from source vectors
  to pick up the recall lift.

#### Fixed

- **x86/ARM recall parity at d=1536 and d=3072, 4-bit.** Previous
  releases silently produced lower recall on x86 than ARM at high
  dim — most visibly at d=3072/4-bit where x86 measured 0.919 @1 vs
  ARM's 0.974 (−5.5pp). Same fix as the Rust crate (porting the
  ARM-style periodic accumulator flush to AVX2 and AVX-512 BW). x86
  search latency is essentially unchanged.

## turbovec 0.5.3 (Python package) + turbovec 0.6.0 (Rust crate) — 2026-05-25

### turbovec — Rust crate (current: 0.5.0 → next: 0.6.0)

#### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `TurboQuantIndex::new`, `TurboQuantIndex::new_lazy`,
  `IdMapIndex::new`, and `IdMapIndex::new_lazy` now return
  `Result<Self, ConstructError>` instead of panicking on invalid
  input. The new `turbovec::ConstructError` enum covers `bit_width`
  out of `{2, 3, 4}` and `dim` not a positive multiple of 8 (which
  also closes a latent hole where `dim = 0` was silently accepted —
  the previous `dim % 8 == 0` assertion vacuously passed for zero,
  then divided-by-zero on the first `add`).

  Migration: append `?` (or `.unwrap()` in tests/binaries) to
  existing constructor calls. Mirrors the [`AddError`](src/error.rs)
  pattern from the previous release.

- **Encode is 2–3× faster on aarch64.** SIMD-ifies the quantize +
  scale + bit-pack inner loop via NEON (compare against boundaries
  in 8 lanes at a time, weighted horizontal-add for the bit-pack)
  and fuses the three passes so there's no intermediate
  `codes: Vec<u8>` allocation. Rayon parallelises across rows on
  both aarch64 and x86_64; x86_64 keeps the existing scalar inner
  loop. Recall is bit-identical to the previous release at every
  published cell (verified against `benchmarks/suite/recall_*.py`
  on M3 Max). Measured throughput on M2 Pro, single-threaded:
  - d=768, 4-bit: 22.5K → 66.3K vec/sec (2.9×)
  - d=1536, 4-bit: 9.5K → 21.9K vec/sec (2.3×)
  - d=1536, 2-bit: 16.6K → 25.7K vec/sec (1.5×)

- **Codebook is now cached across incremental `add` calls.** The
  Lloyd-Max boundaries and centroids are a deterministic function
  of `(bit_width, dim)`, so recomputing them on every `add` was
  wasted work. They're now stored in `OnceLock` cells (the same
  pattern already used for the rotation matrix) and reused across
  calls. No behaviour change; faster incremental indexing.

### turbovec — Python package (current: 0.5.2 → next: 0.5.3)

#### Fixed

- **Linux wheels now actually import.** Every Linux wheel since
  Linux build support was added had a missing `DT_NEEDED` entry for
  `libopenblas`, so `import turbovec` failed at the dynamic linker
  step with `undefined symbol: cblas_sgemm` — even on systems that
  had OpenBLAS installed. The wheel now declares the dependency
  explicitly, and `auditwheel` bundles a self-contained copy of
  `libopenblas` (plus its `libgfortran` / `libquadmath` runtime
  deps) into `turbovec.libs/`. Linux wheel size grows from ~1.8 MB
  to ~11 MB (aarch64) / ~42 MB (x86_64) as a consequence — the
  bundled OpenBLAS contains kernel variants for many micro-archs
  and dispatches at runtime. The Linux release CI now also runs
  `pytest` against the freshly-built wheel on native runners so
  this class of bug can't ship silently again.

#### Changed

- **`TurboQuantIndex` and `IdMapIndex` constructors raise
  `ValueError` on bad input** (`bit_width` outside `{2, 3, 4}`,
  `dim` not a positive multiple of 8, including the previously
  silently-accepted `dim = 0` case). Previously these surfaced as
  `pyo3_runtime.PanicException`, which subclasses `BaseException`
  and so wasn't caught by `except Exception:` — user code can now
  recover from a configuration error as a normal usage error.

- **Encode (build-time, not query-time) is faster on aarch64.**
  Same kernel-level change as the Rust crate; Python users see no
  API change and bit-identical recall at every published cell.
  Building an index with `TurboQuantIndex.add()` is ~2–3× faster on
  M-series macOS and Linux aarch64. x86_64 sees the Rayon
  parallelism but not the SIMD kernel.

## turbovec 0.5.2 (Python package) + turbovec 0.5.0 (Rust crate) — 2026-05-21

### turbovec — Rust crate (current: 0.4.1 → next: 0.5.0)

#### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `TurboQuantIndex::add_2d`, `IdMapIndex::add_with_ids_2d`,
  and `IdMapIndex::add_with_ids` now return `Result<(), AddError>`
  instead of panicking on invalid input. The new `turbovec::AddError`
  enum covers dim mismatch, `dim % 8 != 0` on lazy-commit, vector
  buffer length not a multiple of `dim`, ids/vectors count mismatch,
  and duplicate ids. The low-level `TurboQuantIndex::add(&[f32])` and
  constructor asserts are unchanged — they still panic, since those
  signal contract violations rather than user-input errors.

  Migration: append `?` (or `.unwrap()` in tests/binaries) to existing
  calls. Match on `AddError` if you need to recover from specific
  failure modes.

### turbovec — Python package (current: 0.5.1 → next: 0.5.2)

#### Changed

- **Dim mismatch on `add` / `add_with_ids` now raises `ValueError`**
  instead of surfacing a `pyo3_runtime.PanicException` with a Rust
  backtrace. The previous `PanicException` subclassed `BaseException`
  and so was not caught by `except Exception:` — user code can now
  recover from a wrong-shape batch as a normal usage error. The same
  applies to duplicate ids and length mismatches on
  `IdMapIndex.add_with_ids`.

## turbovec 0.5.1 (Python package) + turbovec 0.4.1 (Rust crate) — 2026-05-18

### turbovec — Rust crate (current: 0.4.0 → next: 0.4.1)

#### Added

- **Block-level early exit for selective mask searches** (closes
  [#30](https://github.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/issues/30)). When a
  search is issued with `Some(mask)` the SIMD kernels now check
  whether each 32-vector block contains any allowed slots before
  doing the LUT lookup + popcount + score-decode work for that
  block. If not, the entire block is short-circuited at one
  integer-load + branch per block. The AVX-512BW path additionally
  short-circuits 64-vector pairs at once where possible.

  Measured speedup at 1% selectivity, 100K vectors, d=1536 (mask
  allowing the last 1K slots): **6.4× on ARM (M3 Max), 12.7× on x86
  (Sapphire Rapids c3-standard-8)**. Unmasked search latency is
  unchanged (the guard only fires when a mask is passed).

  Public API: no change to existing surfaces.

- **`turbovec::search::BLOCKS_SKIPPED_BY_MASK`** — atomic counter
  incremented each time a block is short-circuited. Accessors
  `blocks_skipped_by_mask()` and `reset_blocks_skipped_by_mask()`
  are exposed for hybrid-retrieval telemetry. AVX-512BW pair-level
  skips count as 2.

### turbovec — Python package (current: 0.5.0 → next: 0.5.1)

#### Added

- **Block-level early exit for selective `search_with_mask` calls.**
  Same kernel-level change as the Rust crate; Python users see
  identical API and unchanged unmasked latency. Selective masks now
  run substantially faster (≈6–13× at 1% selectivity, scaling with
  index size — larger indices amortize fixed per-query cost more
  and see larger speedups). Closes
  [#30](https://github.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/issues/30).

## turbovec 0.5.0 (Python package) + turbovec 0.4.0 (Rust crate) — 2026-05-18

> **BREAKING** — on-disk file format version bumped from 1 to 2.
> Existing `.tv` and `.tvim` files written by turbovec ≤ 0.4.3 cannot
> be loaded by 0.5.0+. **Reindex from source vectors to migrate;**
> no in-place migration is provided.

### Migration

If you have indexes built with 0.4.3 or earlier, re-encode them:

```python
import numpy as np
from turbovec import TurboQuantIndex

# Source vectors (the f32 inputs your old index was built from).
vectors = np.load("my_vectors.npy")  # shape (n, dim)

# Build a fresh 0.5.0 index. Same API, same recall guarantees, but with
# the new length-renormalization correction applied.
index = TurboQuantIndex(dim=vectors.shape[1], bit_width=4)
index.add(vectors)
index.write("my_index_v2.tv")
```

If you load an old file under 0.5.0+, you will see:

```
this .tv file was written by turbovec ≤ 0.4.3 (format version 1).
It is incompatible with turbovec 0.4.4+ because the per-vector scalar's
meaning changed. Rebuild this index from the source vectors using
turbovec 0.4.4 or later.
```

### turbovec — Rust crate (current: 0.3.0 → next: 0.4.0)

#### Added

- **Length-renormalized scoring.** The per-vector scalar stored in
  `TurboQuantIndex` is now `||v|| / <u_rot, x̂>` instead of `||v||`,
  giving an unbiased estimator of the inner product. The SIMD kernel
  multiplies by this value at the same site it previously used the
  norm — no change to kernel speed, storage layout, or public API.

#### Changed

- **On-disk format version bumped to 2** for both `.tv` and `.tvim`.
  `.tv` now starts with a 4-byte magic `"TVPI"` + 1-byte version
  prefix; `.tvim` keeps its existing magic with version bumped from 1
  to 2. Loading a v1 file returns `io::Error` of kind `InvalidData`
  with an upgrade-hint message; no in-place migration is provided.
- **`TurboQuantIndex::norms` field renamed to `scales`.** Internal
  rename to match the value's new meaning. The SIMD kernel parameter
  is `vec_scales` (to disambiguate from the per-query LUT calibration
  `scales` parameter inside the same functions).

### turbovec — Python package (current: 0.4.3 → next: 0.5.0)

#### Added

- **Length-renormalized scoring.** Replaces the per-vector `||v||`
  scalar with a RaBitQ-style correction `||v|| / <u_rot, x̂>` that
  removes the systematic bias of the inner-product estimator. The
  SIMD kernel is byte-for-byte unchanged — it multiplies by the new
  scalar at the same site it previously used the norm. Recall@1
  gains across published benchmarks:
  - GloVe-200 2-bit:   0.5053 → 0.5524 (+4.7pp)
  - GloVe-200 4-bit:   0.8115 → 0.8440 (+3.3pp)
  - OpenAI-1536 2-bit: 0.8700 → 0.9060 (+3.6pp)
  - OpenAI-1536 4-bit: 0.9550 → 0.9700 (+1.5pp)
  - OpenAI-3072 2-bit: 0.9120 → 0.9240 (+1.2pp)
  - OpenAI-3072 4-bit: 0.9670 → 0.9800 (+1.3pp)

  Same-session ARM and x86 speed benchmarks confirm no measurable
  search-latency change (deltas within FAISS noise floor on every
  cell). The correction adds one extra dot product per vector at
  encode time — a one-shot cost on the cold path, not visible to
  search.

#### Changed

- **On-disk format version bumped to 2** for both `.tv` and `.tvim`.
  `.tv` files now start with a 4-byte magic `"TVPI"` + 1-byte
  version. `.tvim` files use the existing magic with version byte
  bumped from 1 to 2.
- **Loading a turbovec ≤ 0.4.3 index raises with a clear error.**
  The per-vector scalar's meaning changed (`||v||` → `||v|| / <u_rot, x̂>`),
  so silently re-interpreting v1 files would produce wrong scores.
  The new loader detects v1 files by their format signature and
  raises `OSError` pointing the caller at rebuilding from source
  vectors.

#### Fixed

- **`turbovec.haystack.TurboQuantDocumentStore` clamps cosine scores
  to `[-1, 1]` before `scale_score` rescaling.** Cauchy–Schwarz
  bounds the true cosine in that range, but the LUT scoring kernel's
  float-precision noise can produce values slightly outside it —
  most visibly on a self-query, which is algebraically 1.0 but the
  kernel produces ~1.00016 after its per-sub-table calibration.
  Without the clamp, downstream consumers of `scale_score=True` saw
  scores `> 1.0` and the `[0, 1]` contract was violated. Dot-product
  path uses a sigmoid that is already bounded; no clamp needed there.

## turbovec 0.4.3 (Python package) — 2026-05-18

### turbovec — Python package (current: 0.4.2 → next: 0.4.3)

#### Added

- **Windows x64 wheel** (closes [#31](https://github.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/issues/31)).
  Prior releases shipped only Linux x86_64/aarch64, macOS aarch64, and an
  sdist — Windows users running `pip install turbovec` fell through to
  the sdist and hit a `link.exe` build failure unless they had Rust + MSVC
  installed locally. The release workflow now also builds a
  `cp39-abi3-win_amd64` wheel and validates it by installing and running
  the core pytest suite (`test_index.py`, `test_id_map.py`,
  `test_filtering.py`) on the build runner before upload. Implementation
  in [#33](https://github.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/pull/33).

  Intel Mac (macOS x86_64) was considered alongside Windows but blocked
  by GitHub's December 2025 deprecation of free-tier `macos-13` runners;
  tracked separately in [#34](https://github.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/issues/34).

  No library changes in this release — same Python API, same on-disk
  format, same recall and throughput as 0.4.2. Pure platform-coverage
  patch.

## turbovec 0.4.2 (Python package) — 2026-05-17

### turbovec — Python package (current: 0.4.1 → next: 0.4.2)

#### Fixed

- **`numpy` is now a declared runtime dependency.** The Python package
  and every integration module imports `numpy` unconditionally, and the
  Rust extension's Python surface expects NumPy arrays as input. Prior
  releases relied on `numpy` being pulled in transitively via the
  framework extras (`langchain-core`, `llama-index-core`, `haystack-ai`).
  This broke `pip install turbovec[agno]` in clean environments because
  `agno` doesn't depend on `numpy`. `numpy>=1.20` is now declared in
  `[project].dependencies`, so it's installed regardless of which extra
  (or none) is selected.

## turbovec 0.4.1 (Python package) — 2026-05-17

### turbovec — Python package (current: 0.4.0 → next: 0.4.1)

#### Added

- **Agno integration** (`turbovec.agno`). New `TurboQuantVectorDb` class
  implementing Agno's `VectorDb` interface, structurally aligned with
  `agno.vectordb.lancedb.LanceDb` (the closest in-tree single-machine
  backend). Drop-in for callers that use `LanceDb` as their Agno
  knowledge backend.
  - Dim is sourced from `embedder.dimensions` (matches `LanceDb`); no
    baked-in default.
  - Filtered search uses the kernel-level `allowlist=` path: filters
    resolve to a handle allowlist before scoring, so selective filters
    return up to `limit` results from the filtered set instead of
    fewer-than-`limit` from a post-filter.
  - JSON side-car persistence (no pickle, no
    `allow_dangerous_deserialization` flag).
  - Constructor restricts `search_type=vector` and `distance=cosine`
    — turbovec doesn't ship a BM25/lexical index and stores
    unit-normalized vectors only. Non-vector / non-cosine constructions
    raise `ValueError` rather than silently misbehaving.
  - Honours `similarity_threshold` (cosine → relevance clamped to
    `[0, 1]` via `(s + 1) / 2`), `reranker` (optional rerank pass after
    vector retrieval), `content_id` / `content_hash` payload fields.
  - Full async surface: `async_*` variants for create/insert/upsert/
    search/drop/exists/name_exists, using the embedder's async batch
    paths when available.
  - Install: `pip install turbovec[agno]`.

## turbovec 0.3.0 (Rust crate) — 2026-05-17

### turbovec — Rust crate (current: 0.2.0 → next: 0.3.0)

#### Added

- **Search-time filtering.** New methods restrict the returned top-k to
  a caller-supplied subset of vectors. The kernel applies the filter at
  the heap-update site rather than via post-filtering, so selective
  filters return up to `k` results from the allowed set instead of
  fewer-than-`k` from an over-fetch pass. Output shape shrinks to
  `min(k, n_allowed)` — consistent with the existing `k > len(idx)`
  contract; no sentinel padding.
  ([#21](https://github.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/issues/21))
  - `TurboQuantIndex::search_with_mask(queries, k, mask: Option<&[bool]>)`
    — slot bitmask, length equal to `len(idx)`.
  - `IdMapIndex::search_with_allowlist(queries, k, allowlist: Option<&[u64]>)`
    — external-id allowlist; translated to a slot bitmask internally
    via the existing `id_to_slot` map. Panics on empty allowlist or
    unknown ids.
  - Threaded through every scoring path: NEON (aarch64), AVX2
    (x86_64), AVX-512BW (x86_64), and the scalar fallback.

- **Lazy index construction.** The dim can now be deferred and inferred
  from the first batch of vectors, rather than committed at construction
  time. This is the same ergonomic improvement integration users were
  already getting through the framework wrappers, pulled down into the
  core so direct Rust users and any future integration get it for free.
  - `TurboQuantIndex::new_lazy(bit_width)` and
    `IdMapIndex::new_lazy(bit_width)` — construct an empty index with
    no committed dim.
  - `TurboQuantIndex::add_2d(vectors, dim)` and
    `IdMapIndex::add_with_ids_2d(vectors, dim, ids)` — add a flat
    vector batch with an explicit dim; locks the index dim on the
    first call, validates on subsequent ones. Existing `add(&[f32])` /
    `add_with_ids(&[f32], &[u64])` still work on a dim-known index and
    panic with a clear message on a lazy uncommitted one.
  - `TurboQuantIndex::dim_opt()` / `IdMapIndex::dim_opt()` return
    `Option<usize>` — `None` for the lazy uncommitted state. The
    existing `dim() -> usize` getters keep returning `usize`, with `0`
    as a non-breaking sentinel for the lazy state (the eager
    constructor asserts `dim >= 8`, so `0` doesn't collide).
  - File format: `.tv` and `.tvim` headers encode the lazy state via
    a `dim = 0` sentinel. Files written before this change always have
    `dim >= 8` and load cleanly into the eager state.

#### Changed

- `search`, `search_with_mask`, and `prepare` on `TurboQuantIndex`
  return empty results / are no-ops when called on a lazy
  uncommitted index, rather than panicking.

## turbovec 0.4.0 (Python package) — 2026-05-17

### turbovec — Python package (current: 0.3.0 → next: 0.4.0)

#### Added

- **Search-time filtering.** Same feature surfaced as keyword-only
  arguments on `search`:
  - `TurboQuantIndex.search(queries, k, *, mask=None)` — `mask` is a
    NumPy `bool` array of shape `(len(idx),)`.
  - `IdMapIndex.search(queries, k, *, allowlist=None)` — `allowlist`
    is a NumPy `uint64` array of external ids.
  - Pre-validates shape, dtype, emptiness and unknown ids and raises
    `ValueError` / `KeyError` rather than letting the Rust panic
    surface as `pyo3.PanicException`.
  ([#21](https://github.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec/issues/21))

- **Lazy construction.** `TurboQuantIndex(dim=None, bit_width=4)` and
  `IdMapIndex(dim=None, bit_width=4)` now accept an optional `dim`.
  When omitted, the dim is inferred from the first `.add(...)` /
  `.add_with_ids(...)` call using the input array's shape. The
  framework integrations all rely on this internally now.
- `.dim` property on both index types now returns `int | None` (was
  `int`); `None` means the index hasn't seen its first add yet.

#### Changed

- **Haystack integration** (`turbovec.haystack`):
  `TurboQuantDocumentStore` is now a structural drop-in for
  `haystack.document_stores.in_memory.InMemoryDocumentStore`. Audited
  against `haystack-ai 2.28.0` and brought up to parity. In addition
  to the earlier filter-resolution fix:
  - `dim` is now optional in the constructor; the index is built
    lazily on the first `write_documents`.
  - Constructor accepts `embedding_similarity_function`
    (`"cosine"` default, since turbovec stores unit-normalized
    vectors), `async_executor`, and `return_embedding` for parity
    with the reference. `scale_score=True` now uses the right
    per-similarity-function formula (`(s + 1) / 2` for cosine,
    `expit(s / 100)` for dot product), fixing a pre-existing bug.
  - 12 `*_async` variants added (`count_documents_async`,
    `filter_documents_async`, `write_documents_async`,
    `delete_documents_async`, `delete_all_documents_async`,
    `update_by_filter_async`, `count_documents_by_filter_async`,
    `count_unique_metadata_by_filter_async`,
    `get_metadata_fields_info_async`, `get_metadata_field_min_max_async`,
    `get_metadata_field_unique_values_async`, `embedding_retrieval_async`).
  - 8 utility methods added (`delete_all_documents`,
    `delete_by_filter`, `update_by_filter`, `count_documents_by_filter`,
    `count_unique_metadata_by_filter`, `get_metadata_fields_info`,
    `get_metadata_field_min_max`, `get_metadata_field_unique_values`),
    plus a `storage` property and `shutdown()`.
  - `write_documents` now validates its input and raises
    `ValueError("Please provide a list of Documents.")` on bad input
    instead of an opaque `AttributeError`.
  - Persistence methods renamed to match the reference:
    `save → save_to_disk`, `load → load_from_disk`. (No deprecation
    shims — pre-this-change persisted stores load fine, but the method
    names change.)

- **LangChain integration** (`turbovec.langchain`):
  `TurboQuantVectorStore` is now a structural drop-in for
  `langchain_core.vectorstores.in_memory.InMemoryVectorStore`. Audited
  against `langchain_core 0.3.63`. In addition to the earlier filter
  fixes:
  - `__init__` no longer requires a pre-built `IdMapIndex`. Lazy
    construction lets `TurboQuantVectorStore(embedding)` work
    directly — same no-arg ergonomics as the reference.
  - `_select_relevance_score_fn` override added — maps the raw cosine
    similarity into `[0, 1]` so `similarity_search_with_relevance_scores`
    and `as_retriever(search_type="similarity_score_threshold")` work.
    Result is clamped to `[0, 1]` to absorb the small overshoot caused
    by quantization noise.
  - `get_by_ids` / `aget_by_ids` implemented from the side-car
    docstore.
  - `add_documents` overrides the base-class default so partial
    `Document.id` is honoured per-document (some ids explicit, others
    UUID-generated) instead of being dropped wholesale.
  - True async overrides: `aadd_documents`, `aadd_texts` and
    `asimilarity_search_with_score` use `aembed_documents` /
    `aembed_query` for genuine async embedding generation;
    `asimilarity_search`, `asimilarity_search_by_vector`,
    `amax_marginal_relevance_search`, `afrom_texts`, `adelete` are
    explicit overrides too.
  - `delete` now returns `None` (was `bool`) and is a no-op when
    called with `ids=None` — matches the reference's contract.
  - `max_marginal_relevance_search` / `_by_vector` /
    `amax_marginal_relevance_search` raise `NotImplementedError` with
    a clear message rather than the base class's bare
    `NotImplementedError`. MMR isn't faithfully implementable on a
    quantized index because the algorithm requires full-precision
    candidate vectors that turbovec discards after encoding.
  - Persistence methods renamed: `save_local → dump`, `load_local →
    load`, matching the reference.

- **LlamaIndex integration** (`turbovec.llama_index`):
  `TurboQuantVectorStore` is now a structural drop-in for
  `llama_index.core.vector_stores.simple.SimpleVectorStore`. Audited
  against `llama_index.core 0.12.39`. In addition to the earlier
  filter fixes:
  - `__init__` no longer requires a pre-built `IdMapIndex`;
    `TurboQuantVectorStore()` works directly. `from_params(dim=None,
    bit_width=4)` is also lazy.
  - `get_nodes(node_ids, filters)` implemented (the reference raises
    NotImplementedError because it doesn't store nodes; we do).
    `clear()` resets state while preserving `bit_width`.
  - `to_dict` / `from_dict` for config round-trip.
  - `get(text_id)` raises `NotImplementedError` with an explanation —
    we can't return the original embedding (quantized away).
  - `delete_nodes(node_ids, filters)` now honours `filters` (previously
    raised). Both constraints intersect when supplied.
  - Async overrides for `async_add`, `adelete`, `adelete_nodes`,
    `aclear`, `aquery`, `aget_nodes`.
  - **StorageContext compatibility**: new
    `from_persist_dir(persist_dir, namespace, fs)` matching the
    reference's namespaced-filename convention, so
    `StorageContext.from_defaults(persist_dir=...)` works. The
    `persist` / `from_persist_path` on-disk layout is now stem-based:
    `persist_path` is a path *stem* and we write `{stem}.tvim` +
    `{stem}.nodes.json` next to each other. This fits StorageContext's
    file-shaped paths and lets multiple namespaced stores share a
    directory.

- **JSON side-cars across all three integrations.** Haystack, LangChain
  and LlamaIndex persistence now writes a plain-JSON side-car next to
  the binary `IdMapIndex` payload instead of a pickle. The
  `allow_dangerous_deserialization` flag is gone everywhere — loading
  is safe regardless of file provenance. Document / node metadata must
  be JSON-serializable, which matches the constraint the reference
  in-tree stores already impose. The side-car carries a
  `schema_version` field; loaders reject unknown versions instead of
  silently misinterpreting bytes.
